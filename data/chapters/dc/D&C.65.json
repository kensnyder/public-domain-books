  "briefOverview": "A prophetic prayer-proclamation announces that God’s kingdom and authority are on earth and will expand worldwide, calling people to prepare for the Lord’s coming.",
  "summary": "A heavenly voice urges all to prepare the way of the Lord and make His paths straight. It declares that the keys of the kingdom are entrusted to humans on earth, and that the gospel will roll forth like a stone cut out of the mountain without hands until it fills the earth. The voice again calls for preparation for the supper of the Lamb and the arrival of the Bridegroom. Believers are instructed to pray, call upon God, and publicly recount His works so that His kingdom may spread and people be ready for coming days. The prayer concludes with a petition that God’s kingdom go forth and His enemies be subdued as the Son of Man comes in glory to meet the established kingdom on earth.",
  "externalContext": "This text dates to the early period of the Latter-day Saint movement (1831), when the church was centered in Ohio and actively engaged in missionary work and community formation. Early Latter-day Saints saw their efforts in eschatological terms, expecting the imminent expansion of God’s work and the eventual return of Christ. The language of a kingdom filling the earth resonated with broader 19th-century restorationist interpretations of biblical prophecies (especially Daniel 2) about God’s final kingdom overcoming worldly powers. Within Latter-day Saint usage, “keys” often denotes divinely delegated authority to govern the church’s affairs and ordinances.",
  "externalReferences": "The image of the stone “cut out of the mountain without hands” that fills the whole earth echoes Daniel 2:34–35, 44–45. The call to “Prepare ye the way of the Lord” aligns with Isaiah 40:3 and its New Testament application to John the Baptist in Matthew 3:3. The mention of the “supper of the Lamb” and the Bridegroom draws on Revelation 19:7–9 and the Bridegroom imagery of Matthew 25:1–13. The “keys of the kingdom” recalls Jesus’s words to Peter in Matthew 16:19, and the coming of the Son of Man in glory parallels Matthew 24:30.",

    "In what concrete ways can I help “prepare the way of the Lord” in my community this week?",
    "How can my personal prayers more intentionally seek the spread of God’s kingdom rather than only personal needs?",
    "What does it mean for me to “receive” the kingdom so I am ready for the days to come?",
    "How can I publicly “make known” God’s works in a respectful and effective way?",
    "Where in my life do I need to straighten paths—habits or priorities—to live in anticipation of Christ’s return?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text distinguishes between the “kingdom of God” going forth and the “kingdom of heaven” coming; the precise relationship or timing between these concepts is not fully explained. It also states that the “keys of the kingdom” are committed to humans without specifying which keys or to whom; readers may infer priesthood authority, but the passage itself does not detail it. The phrase that the Son of Man will come “to meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the earth” leaves open questions about the sequence and manner of that meeting.",

  "briefOverview": "A short revelation directs David W. Patten to settle his affairs and prepare to join a group of twelve on a missionary journey, while warning that any who deny Christ will be replaced in their offices.",
  "summary": "The Lord instructs David W. Patten to settle his business and dispose of his merchandise so he can undertake a mission the following spring with a company of twelve, including himself, to testify of Christ and spread good news worldwide. The revelation warns that if some deny the Lord’s name, others will be planted in their place and receive their bishopric (office).",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is dated to April 1838 in Far West, Missouri, during a turbulent period for the Latter-day Saints. David W. Patten was one of the original members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (called in 1835). Later that year (October 1838), he died from wounds sustained at the Battle of Crooked River and thus did not participate in the mission envisioned for the next spring. The broader plan for the Twelve to depart on a mission from Far West in April 1839 was articulated in a subsequent revelation (Doctrine and Covenants 118).",
  "externalReferences": "The call to “bear glad tidings unto all the world” echoes the Great Commission to preach the gospel to all creation (Mark 16:15). The statement that others will be “planted in their stead and receive their bishopric” parallels Acts 1:20 (“his bishopric let another take”) regarding replacing Judas. A closely related directive about the Twelve departing on a mission the following spring is given in Doctrine and Covenants 118:5–6.",

  "uncertainAreas": "“Twelve including himself” likely refers to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, but the text does not explicitly define the group; similarly, “bishopric” may denote an ecclesiastical office or stewardship broadly, and the identity of those who might “deny my name” is not specified.",

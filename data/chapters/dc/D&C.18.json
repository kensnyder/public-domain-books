  "briefOverview": "Revelation to Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer directing them to rely on revealed writings, preach repentance, and help identify and commission Twelve disciples to take Christ’s name. It emphasizes salvation in Jesus’ name, the worth of souls, and the duties of those called to build the Church on Christ’s gospel and rock.",
  "summary": "The Lord affirms to Oliver Cowdery that what he has written is true and commands reliance on those writings as the foundation of Christ’s church. He states that Joseph Smith has been properly called and baptized according to commandment, and promises eternal life conditioned on diligence. Addressing Oliver and David Whitmer with an apostolic commission, the Lord teaches the great worth of souls, Christ’s atoning death and resurrection, the joy in repentance, and the necessity of faith, hope, and charity. He commands them to preach repentance, take upon them the name of Christ, and declare that salvation comes only in Jesus’ name to those who repent, are baptized, and endure to the end. The Lord announces that twelve disciples are to be called who desire to take His name with full purpose of heart, to preach to every creature, baptize, and ordain priests and teachers, and He assures them His words are given by His own voice and Spirit. Oliver and David are to search out the Twelve by their desires and works, then preach repentance and baptism to all accountable persons; great blessings are promised for obedience and a warning is given that salvation is conditioned on keeping His commandments.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is dated by Latter-day Saint history to June 1829 in Fayette, New York, during the final months of translating the Book of Mormon. Oliver Cowdery had recently served as Joseph Smith’s principal scribe, and both he and David Whitmer would later be named among the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon. In May 1829 Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery reported receiving authority to baptize and then baptized one another, initiating early baptisms among believers. The directive here to identify Twelve disciples anticipated the formal calling of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1835, when Cowdery, Whitmer, and Martin Harris participated in selecting them.",
  "externalReferences": "The promise that building on Christ’s “rock” ensures that the gates of hell will not prevail echoes Matthew 16:18.\n\nThe claim that salvation is found in no other name and the commission to preach and baptize all the world parallel Acts 4:12 and the Great Commission in Mark 16:15–16 (cf. Matthew 28:19).\n\nJoy over one soul who repents recalls Luke 15:7,10, and the triad “faith, hope, and charity” echoes 1 Corinthians 13:13.",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "“The things which you have written” may refer to multiple writings (e.g., Book of Mormon translation, Oliver’s draft articles), and the text does not specify which; the timing and identity of the Twelve are not given here; the phrase “contend against no church, save it be the church of the devil” leaves interpretive questions about application; the “years of accountability” are not defined in the text.",

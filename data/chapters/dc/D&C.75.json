  "briefOverview": "The revelation commissions specific elders to preach, lays out field conduct, and directs the church to support missionaries’ families while condemning idleness.",
  "summary": "The Lord urgently calls those who have volunteered to proclaim the gospel to labor diligently, promising honor and eternal life to the faithful. William E. McLellin’s eastern assignment is revoked and replaced with a southern mission with Luke Johnson, while other pairs (e.g., Orson Hyde with Samuel H. Smith; Lyman Johnson with Orson Pratt) are sent primarily east or south, and some west. Missionaries are to go house to house; if received, they bless the home, and if rejected, they are to depart and shake off the dust as a testimony, with assurance of divine companionship and eventual judgment. The church is commanded to assist in supporting the families of those sent to preach; those who must provide for their families may do so without losing their crown and should still labor in the church. All are admonished to diligence, with no place for idlers unless they repent. The revelation concludes by naming additional pairs to unite in the ministry.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to early 1832 in Ohio, amid rapid organization and expansion of the early Latter-day Saint movement. Missionary work typically occurred two-by-two across the American frontier, relying on hospitality in homes and small communities. Early converts often left families for extended preaching tours, making communal support necessary. Travel directions such as “eastern,” “western,” and “south countries” refer to U.S. regions rather than foreign nations, reflecting the movement’s early American focus.",
  "externalReferences": "The title “Alpha and Omega” reflects Revelation 1:8’s designation of God as the beginning and the end. Field instructions closely echo Jesus’ directions to missionaries in Matthew 10:11–15 and Luke 10:1–12, including entering homes, leaving a blessing if received, and shaking off dust as testimony against rejection. The “Comforter” who will teach them all things recalls John 14:26, and the promise to “ask…knock” follows Matthew 7:7–8. The harvest imagery of being “laden with many sheaves” resonates with Psalm 126:5–6 and the New Testament motif of the plentiful harvest (e.g., Matthew 9:37–38).",

  "uncertainAreas": "The precise historical setting (conference date/location) is not specified in the text; “east,” “west,” and “south countries” are regional but undefined.

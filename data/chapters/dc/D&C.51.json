  "briefOverview": "Revelation to Bishop Edward Partridge on organizing the Saints under consecration, outlining equitable property distribution, legal instruments, and administration of surplus.",
  "summary": "The Lord instructs Edward Partridge to organize the people according to divine law, appointing to each person an equal portion based on family, circumstances, wants, and needs. The bishop is to provide written deeds securing individuals in their stewardships, with provisions that transgressors lose claim to consecrated property but retain what was deeded to them, all in harmony with civil law. An agent is to manage money for food and clothing, and all are to deal honestly and receive alike to foster unity. Resources dedicated to this people are not to be diverted to another church unless properly agreed upon through the bishop or a church-appointed agent. A storehouse is to be established to hold surplus, with the bishop supported for his labors. The land is consecrated to them for a little season, yet they are to act upon it as if for years; faithful and wise stewards are promised eternal life, and Christ affirms He comes quickly.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to 1831 in Ohio, when many Latter-day Saint converts were migrating and needed structured settlement. Edward Partridge was the first bishop of the Church, tasked with managing properties and needs under what early Saints called the law of consecration. American property law required deeds and legal clarity for land transfers, prompting instructions about written instruments and acting within the laws of the land. The concept of a bishop’s storehouse became a lasting administrative feature in the Church’s welfare and resource distribution. The phrase “for a little season” aligns with the era’s expectation of an eventual gathering place in Missouri identified later that year (cf. D&C 57).",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter operationalizes principles earlier revealed in the law of consecration (Doctrine and Covenants 42:30–39), including stewardship and surplus dedicated to the poor. Its communal ethos recalls the early Christian sharing of goods “as every man had need” (Acts 4:32–35). The “storehouse” language resonates with Malachi’s call to bring tithes into the storehouse (Malachi 3:10). The promise to the “faithful and wise steward” and entering into the Lord’s joy echoes Jesus’ parables (Luke 12:42–44; Matthew 25:21), and the declaration that Christ “cometh quickly” parallels Revelation 22:12.",

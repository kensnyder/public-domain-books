  "briefOverview": "The Lord releases Brigham Young from extended travel and instructs him to prioritize care for his family while continuing to spread the gospel.",
  "summary": "The Lord addresses Brigham Young directly, affirming that his past sacrifices and journeys in service have been seen and accepted. He is told that it is no longer required for him to leave his family as before. While still commanded to send the Lord’s word abroad, he is to take special and ongoing care of his family from this time forward.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to July 1841 in Nauvoo, Illinois, shortly after Brigham Young returned from the British Mission (1839–1841), during which the Quorum of the Twelve oversaw major growth in the Church abroad. The period was marked by long, taxing missions that often separated leaders from their families amid illness and frontier hardship. In 1841 the Church also focused on establishing Nauvoo and constructing the temple, requiring key leaders to be present locally. The instruction to care for family reflects the practical strains of leadership and missionary work in that era.",
  "externalReferences": "Earlier revelations had charged the Twelve to depart and preach “across the great waters,” setting in motion the British Mission that Brigham Young helped lead (Doctrine and Covenants 118:1–6), and outlined the Twelve’s worldwide mandate (Doctrine and Covenants 112:1–34). The emphasis on caring for one’s household resonates with the New Testament instruction that believers provide for their own families (1 Timothy 5:8). Paul’s statement about the apostles’ right to attend to familial obligations also provides a parallel (1 Corinthians 9:5).",

    "How can I balance public service or ministry with sustained, intentional care for my family?",
    "In what ways can I help “send the word abroad” through delegation, support, or organization when I cannot travel?",

    "How should leaders discern when a season of direct travel or front-line work should give way to a season of local, family-focused service?"

  "uncertainAreas": "The scope of “send my word abroad” while remaining with family is not specified—whether it implies directing others, writing, or local coordination. The duration implied by “henceforth and forever” may be rhetorical or literal; the text does not clarify future exceptions or changes.",

  "briefOverview": "A prophecy announces wars beginning in South Carolina that expand globally, bringing calamities and divine judgment. It concludes with a call for the faithful to stand in holy places until the Lord’s coming.",
  "summary": "The revelation foretells wars starting with the rebellion of South Carolina, leading to widespread conflict between the Southern and Northern states and eventual involvement of other nations, including Great Britain. It predicts that after many days slaves will rise against their masters and that surviving remnants of the land will vex the Gentiles. The text portrays global mourning through sword, famine, plague, earthquakes, and tempest as instruments of God’s chastening until a decreed consumption brings an end of all nations. This culminates in the cessation of the saints’ cries for justice. The Lord commands believers to stand in holy places and remain steadfast, assuring that the day of the Lord comes quickly.",
  "externalContext": "This text is attributed to Joseph Smith on December 25, 1832, during the United States’ Nullification Crisis centered in South Carolina over federal tariffs. Tensions around states’ rights and slavery continued for decades and erupted into the American Civil War in 1861, beginning with conflict in South Carolina. The Confederacy sought recognition and aid from foreign powers, notably Great Britain and France, though Britain ultimately maintained official neutrality. Latter-day Saint tradition has treated this as a prophecy on the Civil War and subsequent global turmoil, later canonized in the Doctrine and Covenants.",
  "externalReferences": "The imagery of escalating wars, famines, and earthquakes parallels Jesus’s eschatological discourse (Matthew 24:6–8; cf. Luke 21:9–11). The cry for the blood of the saints to be avenged recalls Revelation 6:9–11. The phrase “consumption decreed” echoes language in Isaiah 10:22–23. The admonition to “stand in holy places” closely matches Doctrine and Covenants 45:31–33, and the title “Lord of Sabaoth” appears in James 5:4.",

  "uncertainAreas": "“Remnants who are left of the land” and “Gentiles” are not defined here, leaving their identities and timeline open to interpretation. The scope of “war … poured out upon all nations” and “a full end of all nations” may refer to a long unfolding eschatological process rather than a single event. The phrase “after many days slaves shall rise up” is temporally vague and its historical referents are debated.",

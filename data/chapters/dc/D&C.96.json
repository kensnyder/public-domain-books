  "briefOverview": "Administrative directions for strengthening Zion’s stake in Kirtland and advancing the Lord’s work through stewardship over temple property and membership in the order.",
  "summary": "The text instructs the community to strengthen a designated stake of Zion. Newel K. Whitney is appointed to take charge of the place intended for building the Lord’s holy house, and the land is to be divided into lots to benefit those seeking inheritances, as determined in council. A portion is to support the Lord’s order so that His word may go forth and subdue hearts. The revelation affirms that John Johnson’s offering and prayers are accepted, promising him eternal life if he keeps the commandments, noting his descent from Joseph and covenantal blessings. Johnson is to be ordained to join the order and to remove encumbrances on a named house so he may dwell there.",
  "externalContext": "This section dates to 1833 in Kirtland, Ohio, during a period when the Latter-day Saints were organizing a “stake of Zion” outside Jackson County, Missouri. The “holy house” refers to the Kirtland Temple, whose construction was commanded that year. The “place” likely includes the Peter French Farm, land acquired for church use and the temple site. Newel K. Whitney was the bishop in Kirtland, entrusted with temporal affairs. John Johnson was a significant supporter who had previously housed church leaders and contributed materially. The “order” refers to the United Firm (often called the United Order), which managed church business and publishing to support the church’s mission.",
  "externalReferences": "The directive to build the Lord’s house builds on an earlier command to commence construction of the temple in Kirtland (Doctrine & Covenants 95:1–17). The mention of “the order” aligns with revelations establishing and regulating the United Firm, including instructions about its purpose and membership (Doctrine & Covenants 78:3–4; 82:11–12; 92:1). The emphasis on sending forth God’s word connects with prior mandates that temporal stewardship and consecrated resources support the publication and spread of revelation.",

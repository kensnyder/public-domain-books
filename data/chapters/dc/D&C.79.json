  "briefOverview": "A revelation commissions Jared Carter to preach the gospel in the eastern regions, promising Holy Ghost guidance and success conditioned on faithfulness.",
  "summary": "Jared Carter is directed to travel through the eastern countries, going from city to city, preaching the everlasting gospel with the power of his ordination. The Lord promises to send the Comforter to teach him truth and guide his route. If he is faithful, he will be crowned again with “sheaves,” implying successful harvest or converts. He is encouraged to be glad and not fear, with Jesus Christ affirming the charge.\n",
  "externalContext": "In the early 1830s, the Latter-day Saint movement emphasized itinerant missionary labor across the northeastern and midwestern United States. “Eastern countries” in early church usage typically referred to regions east of the church’s center in Ohio, such as New York and New England. Missionaries often traveled on foot, relied on local hospitality, and preached in homes, meetinghouses, and public venues. “Ordination” here reflects early Latter-day Saint priesthood practice, authorizing preaching and ordinances.\n",
  "externalReferences": "“Glad tidings of great joy” echoes the angelic proclamation in Luke 2:10, applying that celebratory language to missionary preaching. The title “Comforter” for the Holy Spirit reflects Jesus’ promise that the Comforter would teach and guide disciples (John 14:26). The phrase “everlasting gospel” parallels Revelation 14:6, which speaks of an angel bringing the everlasting gospel to preach to all nations. The promise to be “crowned…with sheaves” draws on harvest imagery such as Psalm 126:6 and the New Testament’s harvesting metaphor for missionary work (John 4:35–38).\n",

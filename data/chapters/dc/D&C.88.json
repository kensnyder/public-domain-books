  "chapterOsisID": "D&C.88",
  "briefOverview": "A sweeping revelation on divine light, law, resurrection, and graded glory that culminates in commands to sanctify, organize, learn, and build a house of God, including detailed end-time signs and instructions for the School of the Prophets.",
  "summary": "The Lord promises the \"other Comforter\"—the Holy Spirit of promise—and teaches that the light of Christ fills and governs all creation, giving life, law, and understanding. He explains resurrection and the degrees of glory, asserting that beings inherit glories according to the laws they can abide, while the earth itself will be sanctified for the righteous. A parable of laborers receiving the lord’s countenance in ordered times illustrates how God visits kingdoms and peoples in their appointed seasons. The Saints are commanded to seek God diligently, sanctify themselves, call a solemn assembly, and teach one another by study and by faith in preparation for their missions. Prophetic warnings outline apocalyptic signs and a sequence of angels sounding trumps that announce judgment, resurrection orders, the binding and loosing of Satan, and final victory under Michael. The revelation then directs the Saints to organize, establish a house of God as a house of prayer and learning, adopt orderly, charitable conduct, and institute the School of the Prophets with specific salutations and the ordinance of washing of feet.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was received by Joseph Smith in Kirtland, Ohio, in late December 1832 and early January 1833 and later called by him the \"Olive Leaf\" offered to the Church. It came as leaders were organizing ecclesiastical structures and anticipating the establishment of a temple in Kirtland. The directive to found a \"house of God\" was historically understood to point to the Kirtland Temple, dedicated in 1836. The School of the Prophets, instituted shortly after, provided religious and practical education for church officers amid the intellectual and spiritual ferment of early 19th‑century America.",
  "externalReferences": "The promise of \"another Comforter\" and language about light shining in darkness echo the Gospel of John (John 14:16–18, 26; 1:5). The exhortation to \"ask, seek, knock\" parallels Jesus’ teaching in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 7:7). The sequence of angels sounding trumps, the \"silence in heaven about the space of half an hour,\" and the angel with the everlasting gospel draw on Revelation’s imagery (Revelation 8:1; 14:6; 17–18). The catching up of the saints and the role of Michael resonate with 1 Thessalonians 4:16–17 and Daniel 12:1, while the Bridegroom motif recalls Matthew 25:1–13 and universal confession parallels Philippians 2:10–11.",

    "In what concrete ways can I seek learning \"by study and also by faith\" this month?",

  "uncertainAreas": "The scope and timing of the apocalyptic signs (e.g., silence in heaven for half an hour) are not specified and may be symbolic; the parable of the hours can be read in multiple ways regarding historical epochs or personal visitation; the exact referent of \"another Comforter\" and the mechanics of degrees of glory invite varied interpretations within Latter-day Saint theology.",

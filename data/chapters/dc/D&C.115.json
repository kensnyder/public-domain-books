  "briefOverview": "The revelation formalizes the Church’s name, commands a temple in Far West to be built by divine pattern, and directs the Saints to gather to Zion and its stakes for refuge. It affirms Joseph Smith’s keys and leadership in organizing these efforts.",
  "summary": "Addressing Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Hyrum Smith, Edward Partridge, the high council in Zion, and all elders and members, the Lord declares the official name: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He calls the Saints to arise and shine so their light may be a standard for nations and teaches that gathering to Zion and her stakes will provide defense and refuge from coming wrath. The city of Far West is declared holy ground, and the people are commanded to build a house (temple) to the Lord, beginning work the coming summer, making a start on July 4, and recommencing laying the foundation one year from the revelation’s date. The structure must be built diligently and accepted only if it follows the divinely revealed pattern, with a directive that the leading brethren avoid incurring further debt for this work. The Lord wills that Far West be built up quickly and that additional stakes be appointed as revealed to Joseph, whom He promises to be with and whom He affirms holds the keys of the kingdom and ministry.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to 1838 in Far West, Missouri, during a period when Latter-day Saints were consolidating in Caldwell County after prior conflicts in the state. The formal naming in this text standardized usage after earlier variations in the Church’s designation. July 4, 1838, became a symbolic date for beginning temple-related work at Far West. Financial strain from the Kirtland, Ohio, period, including debt associated with the Kirtland Temple and the broader economic downturn of the late 1830s, forms a backdrop to the instruction to avoid further indebtedness. The concept of Zion located in Missouri and organized through “stakes” reflects the community-building model Latter-day Saints were implementing on the American frontier.",
  "externalReferences": "“Arise and shine forth” and being a “standard for the nations” echo Isaiah’s imagery (Isaiah 60:1; 49:22), and the declaration of “holy” ground recalls Moses before the burning bush (Exodus 3:5). The command to build a house “according to the pattern” parallels the tabernacle instructions given to Moses (Exodus 25:9, 40). The affirmation that Joseph holds “the keys of this kingdom” resonates with Jesus’ bestowal of the “keys of the kingdom” (Matthew 16:19), and the language of “stakes” draws on Isaiah’s tent-stake imagery (Isaiah 54:2).",

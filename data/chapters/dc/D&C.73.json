  "briefOverview": "A revelation directs continued preaching until a forthcoming conference, then instructs Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon to resume and finish the work of translation, offering a pattern for other elders.",
  "summary": "The Lord instructs church leaders to keep preaching and exhorting the nearby churches until an upcoming conference, where missions will be assigned by the conference’s voice. Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon are told it is expedient for them to take up the work of translation again. As practicable, they should preach locally until conference, and afterward continue the translation until it is completed. This schedule is presented as a pattern for the elders until further direction is given. The revelation closes with a brief charge to be disciplined and sober.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is situated in the early 1830s when the Church of Christ (later The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) held regular conferences where assignments and directions for the expanding body of elders were given. Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon were engaged in an ambitious project to revise/translate the Bible (often called the Joseph Smith Translation), which they intermittently paused to address pressing ministerial needs. Early church labor was itinerant, with elders preaching in Ohio and surrounding states, strengthening newly formed branches.",
  "externalReferences": "This directive to resume “translation” coheres with earlier instructions to begin translating the New Testament (Doctrine and Covenants 45:60–61) and follows a prior command temporarily to set aside translation to preach publicly (Doctrine and Covenants 71:1–11). The concluding exhortation, “Gird up your loins and be sober,” mirrors biblical language that urges readiness and sobriety (1 Peter 1:13).",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "How do I balance ministerial service with study and long-term projects in a way that honors changing seasons of work?",
    "In what ways can I sustain and participate in collective decision-making (the “voice” of councils or conferences) when assignments are given?",
    "What personal practices help me remain steady, sober, and prepared when priorities shift?",
    "How can I set a faithful “pattern” for others through my consistency in finishing the work I have begun?",
    "Where can I preach or strengthen nearby communities when travel or time is limited?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text does not explicitly define what “translate again” refers to (assumed to be the Bible translation), which specific conference is meant, or the exact scope of the “pattern” for elders, so these are inferred from broader historical context and nearby revelations.",

  "briefOverview": "Targeted counsel to David, Peter, and John Whitmer directs them to repent, obey authorized counsel, and proclaim the gospel with courage.",
  "summary": "David is reproved for fearing man and focusing on earthly matters rather than relying on God and attending to his calling; he is told to remain at his father’s house and minister as commanded. Peter is instructed to travel with Oliver Cowdery, to speak without fear, to heed Oliver’s counsel, and to share in his afflictions, since Oliver has authority to build the church among the Lamanites and is accountable only to Joseph Smith in church matters. A blessing is promised for diligence and obedience. John is commanded to proclaim the gospel boldly, to labor initially at his brother Philip Burroughs’ and in nearby regions, and to devote himself wholly to Zion, trusting God’s presence despite human opposition.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to the early months of the Latter-day Saint movement (1830) when the Whitmer family in New York played a central role in church affairs. Early church leadership emphasized that Joseph Smith held the right to receive revelations guiding the church, while others served under appointed direction. The “Lamanites” here refers to Native American peoples, whom early Latter-day Saints identified with Book of Mormon peoples. The Lamanite mission led by Oliver Cowdery traveled westward from New York and significantly impacted church growth, including contacts that contributed to the rise of a major church center in Ohio.",
  "externalReferences": "The limitation of churchwide revelatory authority to Joseph Smith echoes Doctrine and Covenants 28:2, 13. Oliver Cowdery’s commission to preach to the Lamanites had been given previously (Doctrine and Covenants 28:8), and this chapter situates Peter Whitmer Jr. under Oliver’s leadership in that mission. The rebuke for fearing man parallels the earlier reproof to Joseph Smith (Doctrine and Covenants 3:7–8). The charge to proclaim “as with the voice of a trump” resonates with the prophetic call to cry aloud (Isaiah 58:1).",

  "briefOverview": "A revelation directs Hyrum Smith to seek wisdom, obtain God’s word, and assist the unfolding work before attempting to preach. It emphasizes obedience, spiritual guidance, repentance, and Christ’s authority as the light of the world.",
  "summary": "God announces a “great and marvelous work” and calls those who desire to labor to reap while the harvest is ready, promising salvation to the faithful reaper. Hyrum is urged to ask, keep the commandments, seek Zion, and value wisdom over riches, with the assurance that gifts and enlightenment will come through faith in Jesus Christ. The Spirit is identified by its fruits—leading to do good, justice, humility, and righteous judgment—and God promises to impart this Spirit to enlighten the mind and bring joy. Hyrum is told to wait to preach until he is called, to obtain the word first, and to be patient in assisting the translation work. He is to treasure up the word, deny not revelation and prophecy, and build on the gospel as rock. The Lord identifies Himself as Jesus Christ, the life and light of the world, promising power to those who receive Him to become the sons of God.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is traditionally dated to May 1829 and addressed to Hyrum Smith, Joseph Smith’s older brother, during the period of translating the Book of Mormon in Harmony, Pennsylvania. At this time, no formal church organization yet existed (the Church of Christ was organized in April 1830), and several associates were seeking direction on how to participate in the emerging movement. Early Latter-day Saint discourse often spoke of a coming “marvelous work” tied to the restoration of divine authority and the publication of new scripture. The counsel to “wait” before preaching reflects a phase when translation and foundational instruction were prioritized before public ministry.",
  "externalReferences": "The description of God’s word as “sharper than a two-edged sword” echoes Hebrews 4:12. The call to “ask…seek…knock” parallels Matthew 7:7–8, and the imagery of a ripe field ready for harvest recalls John 4:35. The portrayal of Christ as the life and light of the world and the promise that those who receive Him become the sons of God reflect Johannine themes, especially John 1:11–12 and John 8:12. The exhortation to seek the kingdom with the promise that “all things shall be added” parallels Matthew 6:33.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The exact nature of Hyrum’s unspecified “gift” is not identified; whether “say nothing but repentance” implies exclusive verbal content or an overarching emphasis is unclear; the timing indicators (e.g., “wait a little longer,” “until you shall have my word, my rock, my church”) are contextually tied to unfolding events but not specified in the text itself.",

  "briefOverview": "A revelation appoints Warren A. Cowdery to preside and preach in the region of Freedom, with counsel to watch for the Lord’s coming and promises conditioned on humility and faithfulness.",
  "summary": "The text designates Warren A. Cowdery as a presiding high priest over the church in the land of Freedom and surrounding areas, commissioning him to preach and warn neighboring counties. He is instructed to devote himself fully to this calling, with assurance that needed temporal support will accompany faithful service because the laborer is worthy of his hire. The revelation warns that the Lord’s coming approaches like a thief in the night, urging readiness so disciples remain children of light. It affirms heaven’s joy over Warren’s submission and separation from worldly crafts, acknowledges his vanity, and promises mercy if he remains humble. God pledges grace and assurance so he may stand, and a prepared crown awaits him if he is a faithful witness and a light to the church.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to November 1834, during a period when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had scattered branches in New York and Ohio, and leaders sometimes appointed regional presiding high priests to oversee local congregations. Warren A. Cowdery was a resident of Freedom, New York, and the older brother of Oliver Cowdery, an early church leader. Early Latter-day Saint practice sometimes set apart individuals for full-time ministerial labors, with the expectation that the community would provide necessary temporal support.",
  "externalReferences": "The charge to seek the kingdom with the assurance that necessities will be added echoes Matthew 6:33, and the phrase “the laborer is worthy of his hire” parallels Luke 10:7 and 1 Timothy 5:18. The warning about the Lord’s coming as “a thief in the night” and the call to be “children of light” closely parallel 1 Thessalonians 5:2–5 and 2 Peter 3:10. The promised “mansions” and a “crown” for the faithful resonate with John 14:2; James 1:12; and 2 Timothy 4:8. The joy in heaven over Warren’s submission recalls the rejoicing over repentance in Luke 15:7.",

    "What would it look like for me to prioritize God’s work so that needed temporal things are “added,” rather than driving my choices by anxiety over provisions?",
    "How can I cultivate habits that keep me spiritually alert as one of the “children of light”?",
    "In what ways might pride or vanity be hindering my service, and how can I practice humility to receive mercy and guidance?",
    "How can I support full-time ministers or leaders so they can devote themselves wholly to their callings?",
    "What commitments would help me be a reliable “light” and witness in my local faith community?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "“Presiding high priest” likely denotes a regional leadership role, but the exact scope of Warren’s jurisdiction is not specified. The “land of Freedom” probably refers to Freedom, New York, but the boundaries of the area are unclear. The phrase “crafts of men” is ambiguous; it could indicate worldly occupations or practices he set aside, but the text does not define it or specify the nature of his former activities.",

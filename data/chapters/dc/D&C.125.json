  "briefOverview": "A directive instructs Latter-day Saints in the Iowa Territory to gather and build designated communities under prophetic appointment.",
  "summary": "The Lord addresses the Saints in the Iowa Territory, instructing those who take His name to obey His will by gathering to places appointed through His servant Joseph. They are to build cities to His name in preparation for future events. Specifically, they are commanded to build a city opposite Nauvoo and name it Zarahemla. All who come from any direction and desire to dwell there may receive inheritances in Zarahemla, as well as in Nashville, Nauvoo, and other appointed stakes.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is historically linked to early 1841, when Latter-day Saints, recently expelled from Missouri (1838–1839), were establishing Nauvoo, Illinois, and associated settlements across the Mississippi River in the Iowa Territory. The Iowa Territory had been created in 1838, and many Saints settled in Lee County, directly opposite Nauvoo, in communities including Montrose and Nashville. Joseph Smith was organizing stakes (local ecclesiastical units) around Nauvoo as part of a broader gathering program and city-building effort.",
  "externalReferences": "The name “Zarahemla” echoes the major Nephite city in the Book of Mormon (see Omni 1:12–19; Alma 2:26–27), suggesting a symbolic linkage between ancient covenant communities and the new settlement. The directive to gather to appointed places continues themes from earlier Latter-day Saint revelations about Zion, stakes, and refuge (Doctrine & Covenants 115:5–6; 124:1–145). The phrase about people coming from the east, west, north, and south parallels biblical language about gathering from all directions (Luke 13:29; Psalm 107:3). The instruction to build cities “unto my name” reflects the scriptural pattern of sanctifying places for divine purposes (cf. D&C 124 on Nauvoo’s founding and ordinances).",

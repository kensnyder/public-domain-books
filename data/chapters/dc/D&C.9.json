  "chapterOsisID": "D&C.9",
  "briefOverview": "The Lord instructs Oliver Cowdery to pause his attempt to translate and continue serving as scribe to Joseph Smith, teaching him how to seek confirmation through study and spiritual impressions.",
  "summary": "Oliver is told to continue writing for Joseph until the current record is finished, with a promise that he may assist in translating other records later. He is counseled to be patient and informed that his privilege to translate was withdrawn because he did not persist and feared. The Lord clarifies the process of revelation: first study a matter out in the mind, then ask for confirmation; a confirming “burning” in the bosom signals rightness, while a “stupor of thought” signals error. Oliver is assured Joseph has sufficient strength for the work now, and neither is condemned. He is promised prosperity, protection, and ultimate exaltation if he is faithful and steadfast.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is addressed to Oliver Cowdery in 1829 during the translation of the Book of Mormon, when he was serving as Joseph Smith’s principal scribe. Earlier instructions had raised the possibility that Oliver might translate, which he attempted briefly. The experience prompted further guidance on how revelation is received and on the distinct stewardships in the work. Oliver remained a key early leader and later one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon.",
  "externalReferences": "Doctrine and Covenants 8:1–5 precedes this chapter and describes the spirit of revelation operating “in your mind and in your heart,” setting up the further instruction here to “study it out” and then ask. Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–24 addresses personal revelation and remembering spiritual assurances, thematically related to the counsel to avoid fear and be faithful. Luke 24:32 (“Did not our heart burn within us…”) provides a biblical parallel to the metaphor of a confirming “burning” in the bosom. James 1:5 encourages asking God for wisdom; this section complements that by emphasizing thoughtful preparation before asking.",

    "Do I thoughtfully study options before asking God for guidance, or do I expect answers without preparation?",
    "How do I respond when my desired role is delayed or redirected—do I murmur or continue faithfully in the assignment given?",
    "What does a confirming or cautionary impression feel like to me, and how can I record and discern those patterns?",

    "How can I support others’ callings while remaining steadfast in my own stewardship?"

  "uncertainAreas": "“Other records” to be translated are not specified; their identity and timing are unclear from the text alone. The precise phenomenology of a “burning in the bosom” or “stupor of thought” is metaphorical and may vary in individual experience. The extent to which fear versus other factors led to the withdrawal of Oliver’s translation privilege is not detailed.",

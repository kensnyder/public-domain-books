  "briefOverview": "Instruction to leaders about building Zion emphasizes endurance through tribulation, personal initiative, lawful conduct, and consecrated stewardship.",
  "summary": "The Lord addresses the elders, promising glory after tribulation and urging trust in His unseen designs. He commissions them to lay the foundation of Zion, prepare a feast for the poor, and send forth testimony so that all nations may be invited to the Lord’s supper. Edward Partridge is appointed to judge inheritances according to revealed law, and leaders are warned against pride while commanded to keep both divine and civil laws. The Lord teaches that He does not command in all things; disciples should be anxiously engaged and act as agents unto themselves, lest slothful, reluctant obedience bring condemnation. Detailed temporal instructions follow: consecrate funds, purchase lands in Independence for a storehouse and printing, appoint an agent, send workmen, and gather in order by purchase rather than conflict. Named individuals (Martin Harris, W. W. Phelps, Sidney Rigdon, Ziba Peterson) receive specific counsel, and the elders are to hold conferences, dedicate the land and temple site, preach by the way, and carry the gospel to all the world in anticipation of the Son of Man’s coming.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was received in 1831 in Independence, Missouri, shortly after previous instructions identified the area as the center place of Zion and appointed Edward Partridge as bishop. Early Latter-day Saints were organizing a communal economic system often called the law of consecration, with a bishop’s storehouse and stewardships to aid the poor and build the community. At this stage, leaders aimed to acquire land lawfully and systematically for settlement and church operations, including printing. W. W. Phelps was a printer and editor, and Sidney Rigdon a senior spokesman and orator, which contextualizes their assignments to write, describe, and dedicate the land.",
  "externalReferences": "The feast imagery—“a feast of fat things… of wine on the lees well refined” and the universal invitation—evokes Isaiah 25:6, Jesus’ parable of the great banquet inviting the poor, lame, and blind (Luke 14:21–24), and the “marriage supper of the Lamb” (Revelation 19:9). The charge to be “subject to the powers that be” parallels Romans 13:1–7, and the commission to preach “unto every creature, with signs following” mirrors Mark 16:15–17. The phrase “he whose right it is to reign” recalls Ezekiel 21:27; within the Doctrine and Covenants, this builds on D&C 57 (designation of Zion in Independence) and presupposes “my law” of consecration and the storehouse (D&C 42:30–39).",

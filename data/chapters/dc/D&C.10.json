  "briefOverview": "Counsel to resume translation after the lost manuscript, exposing a plot to discredit the work and directing use of the plates of Nephi; Christ declares His identity, His gospel, and who belongs to His church.",
  "summary": "The Lord rebukes the translator for delivering sacred writings to an untrustworthy man, notes the temporary loss and restoration of the translating gift, and counsels diligence, prayer, and measured effort. He reveals a satanic plan: enemies have altered the stolen words to demand a retranslation and then accuse the translator of contradiction. God therefore commands not to retranslate the lost portion but to translate instead from the plates of Nephi, which contain a more particular account sufficient for His purposes and will confound the plot. The Lord explains that this record will bring His gospel to the Lamanites and others upon the land, building up rather than destroying what people already have received. He promises to establish His church among the faithful and warns those who build churches for gain and promote wickedness. Jesus identifies Himself as the Son of God and the light uncomprehended by darkness, affirms He has “other sheep,” and that their works and the gospel among them will come to light. He reduces contention by defining His doctrine: whoever repents and comes to Him is His church; those who add to or take from this are not of Him, but those who endure to the end will stand upon His rock.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is associated with events in 1828–1829 during the early translation of the Book of Mormon. A sizable initial manuscript—commonly called the “116 pages”—was loaned to a supporter, lost, and not recovered; Joseph Smith reported using the Urim and Thummim in the translation process. Latter-day Saint history identifies Martin Harris as the man who requested the loan and acted as scribe for the lost material. The instruction to translate from the “plates of Nephi” corresponds to using the Small Plates of Nephi as a replacement narrative source for the lost portion, rather than re-translating the original material (an abridgment on the Large Plates). The Book of Mormon was subsequently published in 1830 in upstate New York amid significant public scrutiny and controversy.",
  "externalReferences": "The declaration “Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold” echoes Jesus’s saying in John 10:16, here applied to a branch of the house of Jacob. “The light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not” reflects John 1:5. The promise that “the gates of hell shall not prevail” recalls Matthew 16:18. The imagery of gathering “as a hen gathereth her chickens” parallels Matthew 23:37, and the invitation to “partake of the waters of life freely” resonates with Revelation 22:17.",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text does not name the “wicked man” or precisely identify “this land,” leaving some historical and geographical specifics to external sources. The scope of “my church” here may be read as both a defined institution and a covenant community defined by repentance and coming to Christ; balancing those senses can be interpretively delicate. The precise internal mapping of the “plates of Nephi” to later published sections requires reliance on external historical reconstructions.",

  "briefOverview": "The revelation postpones the immediate redemption of Zion, rebukes disunity and neglect of the poor, and directs the Saints to prepare spiritually for an endowment before proceeding. It emphasizes lawful means, purchasing lands, and seeking peace rather than warfare.",
  "summary": "The Lord explains that the Saints’ transgressions—especially disobedience, failure to care for the poor, and lack of unity—prevent Zion’s redemption. He commands a delay “for a little season” so the people can be taught, gain experience, and so the first elders can be endowed with power from on high. Though some did not heed the call to gather, those who did are accepted, their faith is tried, and they are to remain or return as appointed. The Saints are to avoid boasting, quietly gather, seek legal redress, and purchase lands in Jackson County and surrounding areas under the law of consecration. Only after becoming a great, sanctified people will they lawfully and powerfully reclaim their lands, but for now they are to “sue for peace” to all people and trust that the Lord will fight their battles.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was received in June 1834 during the Zion’s Camp expedition, an effort led by Joseph Smith to aid Latter-day Saints expelled from Jackson County, Missouri, in late 1833. Tensions between Mormon settlers and earlier Missourians involved economic, political, and religious conflicts that escalated into violence and displacement. The expedition reached Missouri but, amid legal complexities, local hostility, and disease, did not engage in battle and was disbanded. The instruction to wait for an endowment anticipates the Kirtland Temple’s completion and associated spiritual experiences in 1836, which early Latter-day Saints interpreted as preparatory empowerment for future missions and church governance.",
  "externalReferences": "The instruction to delay redemption echoes and modifies the earlier call to gather strength for Zion in Doctrine and Covenants 103:15–20, while reaffirming that the Lord would “fight your battles.” The identification of Jackson County as Zion draws on Doctrine and Covenants 57:1–3. Phrases such as being “endowed with power from on high” recall Luke 24:49, and imagery like “fair as the sun, and clear as the moon” parallels Song of Songs 6:10. The softening of hearts “as I did the heart of Pharaoh” references Exodus 7:3, and the phrase about visiting iniquity to the “third and fourth generation” reflects Exodus 20:5; the vision of the world acknowledging God’s kingdom resonates with Revelation 11:15, and raising an ensign to the nations aligns with Isaiah 11:12; 49:22.",

  "briefOverview": "Guidance on conducting inclusive worship meetings and seeking spiritual gifts, with emphasis on discernment and holiness.",
  "summary": "The revelation instructs church leaders to conduct meetings under the direction of the Holy Spirit and not to exclude anyone from public meetings, nor sincere seekers from sacrament and confirmation meetings. Members who have trespassed are not to partake of the sacrament until they reconcile. Believers are urged to ask of God, to avoid deception, and to seek the best spiritual gifts for righteous purposes. A range of gifts is listed—such as knowledge of Christ, faith to heal and be healed, wisdom, knowledge, miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, tongues, and interpretation—given so all may be benefited. Bishops and appointed leaders are to discern true gifts and guard against false claims, and all actions are to be done in the name of Christ with gratitude, virtue, and holiness.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was given in early 1831 as the Latter-day Saint movement gathered in Kirtland, Ohio, where new converts and visitors brought varied expectations about worship. Early meetings sometimes included enthusiastic or confusing spiritual manifestations, prompting concerns about order and authenticity. The instruction here addresses how to welcome seekers while maintaining discernment and spiritual direction in congregational life. It also situates bishops and elders as responsible for overseeing and discerning gifts in the community.",
  "externalReferences": "The catalog and purpose of spiritual gifts closely parallel Paul’s teaching in 1 Corinthians 12:4–11, 27–31 and his guidance on orderly worship in 1 Corinthians 14:1–33. The Book of Mormon similarly lists and interprets spiritual gifts in Moroni 10:8–18. The call to “ask of God, who giveth liberally” echoes James 1:5, while the warning against asking for a sign to satisfy lusts resonates with James 4:3 and Jesus’ rebuke of sign-seeking in Matthew 12:39.",

    "Which spiritual gifts might I seek to benefit others, and how can I ask in the Spirit rather than for self-promotion?",
    "What practices help a congregation discern between true and misleading spiritual manifestations?",

  "uncertainAreas": "The precise distinctions between “differences of administration” and “diversities of operations” are not defined. The scope of “public,” “sacrament,” and “confirmation” meetings in varied modern contexts may be interpreted differently. The statement that some may have “all those gifts, that there may be a head” could refer either to Christ’s primacy or to the need for recognized leadership; the text does not specify.",

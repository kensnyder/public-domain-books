  "briefOverview": "Revelation given at the church’s organization, designating Joseph Smith’s prophetic roles and instructing the Saints to heed his words with faith and patience.",
  "summary": "The Lord commands that a record be kept and identifies Joseph Smith as a seer, translator, prophet, apostle, and elder, called by God’s will and grace. The newly organized church (April 6, 1830) is directed to heed Joseph’s words as if from the Lord, with patience and faith, promising that the powers of hell will not prevail and that God will act for their good. God affirms Joseph’s divinely inspired labor for Zion and promises blessings to those who work in His vineyard and believe the words given by the Comforter concerning Jesus’ atoning crucifixion. The revelation instructs that Joseph be ordained by Oliver Cowdery, establishing order and identifying Joseph as first to Oliver, so that Oliver might serve as an elder in the Church. It further appoints the first preacher of the Church to preach to the Church, the world, the Gentiles, and also to the Jews.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is historically associated with April 6, 1830, the date when Joseph Smith and early believers formally organized what they called the Church of Christ in upstate New York, commonly remembered as at the Whitmer home in Fayette. Early Latter-day Saint governance included the office of elder and emphasized orderly ordination and record-keeping; the command to keep a record contributed to early minute books and later history projects. Joseph Smith was recognized as the Church’s founding prophet, and Oliver Cowdery served alongside him in prominent leadership, often titled the Second Elder. The charge to preach to Gentiles and Jews reflects early missionary aims within a broader restorationist Christian movement in early 19th-century America.",
  "externalReferences": "“The gates of hell shall not prevail” echoes Jesus’s promise regarding His Church in Matthew 16:18. The title “Comforter” for the Holy Ghost, who testifies of Christ, reflects Johannine language (John 14:26; 15:26). The statement that Jesus was crucified by sinful men for the sins of the world resonates with apostolic preaching (Acts 2:23; 1 Corinthians 15:3), and the directive to receive the prophet’s word as God’s own parallels Doctrine and Covenants 1:38.",

  "uncertainAreas": "Verses 10–12 involve pronoun ambiguities: “he should be ordained by you” most naturally refers to Joseph being ordained by Oliver, establishing Joseph as first elder and Oliver as an elder under his hand, though the sequence can be read variously. The identity of “the first preacher of this church” in v.12 could be read as Joseph or Oliver; the text does not explicitly name which, and early historical practice involved both preaching prominently.",

  "briefOverview": "A revelation appoints Frederick G. Williams as a counselor to Joseph Smith and outlines his duties of prayerful, compassionate ministry under the authority of the Presidency of the High Priesthood.",
  "summary": "The Lord calls Frederick G. Williams to be a high priest and counselor to Joseph Smith, who holds the keys of the kingdom that belong to the Presidency of the High Priesthood. Williams is promised blessing as he is faithful in his office, in constant prayer both publicly and privately, and in proclaiming the gospel. He is charged to do the greatest good by serving others—succoring the weak, lifting hands that hang down, and strengthening feeble knees. If faithful to the end, he is promised a crown of immortality and eternal life in the Father’s house. The voice identifying itself as Alpha and Omega, Jesus Christ, seals the revelation.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to early 1832, a period when the Church of Christ (later The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) was formalizing leadership structures, including the Presidency of the High Priesthood (often called the First Presidency). Frederick G. Williams, a physician and early convert, was called to serve as a counselor to Joseph Smith during this time of rapid organization and missionary expansion. Historical manuscripts indicate the original revelation named Jesse Gause; after Gause departed from church fellowship, Frederick G. Williams assumed the role, and published editions reflected his name. The setting reflects early Kirtland-era developments in ecclesiastical authority and administrative responsibilities.",
  "externalReferences": "The charge to “lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees” echoes Isaiah 35:3 and is repeated in Hebrews 12:12, framing ministry as strengthening the discouraged. The phrase “keys of the kingdom” recalls Matthew 16:19, where authority to bind and loose is entrusted by Christ. The promise of “many mansions” in the Father’s house parallels John 14:2, and the assurance of a “crown of immortality” aligns with the “crown of life” promised in James 1:12 and Revelation 2:10. The divine self-identification as “Alpha and Omega” mirrors Revelation 1:8; 22:13.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The text addresses a specific office and person; applying these charges universally requires care. Historical substitution of Frederick G. Williams’s name for Jesse Gause’s in published editions sits outside the text and may shape interpretation. The scope of “keys of the kingdom” is referenced but not defined here, leaving details of that authority to other sources.",

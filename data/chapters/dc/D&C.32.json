  "briefOverview": "A revelation commissions Parley P. Pratt to join Oliver Cowdery, Peter Whitmer Jr., and Ziba Peterson in preaching among the Lamanites, with promises of divine accompaniment and counsel to be humble, heed written revelation, and pray continually.",
  "summary": "The Lord appoints Parley P. Pratt to declare the gospel with meekness and to accompany Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer Jr. to preach among the Lamanites. Ziba Peterson is added to the group. God promises to go with them and advocate for them so nothing will prevail against their mission. They are instructed to heed what is already written and not claim additional revelation beyond it, and to pray always so the Lord can unfold understanding. A final admonition to take the message seriously is paired with a promise of blessing.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to October 1830, early in the Latter-day Saint movement, when leaders organized missions beyond New York. In that period, “Lamanites” referred to Indigenous peoples of the Americas as identified in the Book of Mormon. The designated missionaries undertook a difficult journey west, and along their route they preached in Ohio, contributing to significant growth among new converts in the Kirtland area. Parley P. Pratt was a recent convert and experienced preacher, which likely influenced his selection for this mission.",
  "externalReferences": "This directive continues earlier assignments: Oliver Cowdery had previously been commanded to go to the Lamanites (Doctrine and Covenants 28:8), and Peter Whitmer Jr. was told to accompany him (Doctrine and Covenants 30:5–6); Section 32 adds Parley P. Pratt and Ziba Peterson. The caution to “pretend to no other revelation” aligns with the principle in Doctrine and Covenants 28:2 that Joseph Smith alone was appointed to receive commandments for the Church. The phrase “advocate with the Father” echoes 1 John 2:1, and the call to be “meek and lowly of heart” parallels Matthew 11:29.",

    "How can I approach assignments with meekness and lowliness of heart?",
    "What does it look like in practice to rely on established revelation and avoid overreaching claims?",
    "How can I cultivate the habit of praying always so that understanding can unfold?",
    "Where do I need to “trifle not” with sacred responsibilities in my life?",
    "In challenging endeavors, how do I act in faith that God is an advocate and present companion?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "“That which is written” may refer to previously given revelations or to the scriptures more broadly; the text does not specify. The scope of “pretend to no other revelation” is contextual—likely related to contemporary concerns about unauthorized revelations, but the passage itself does not name the specific incident. The term “Lamanites” reflects a theological identification that readers may understand differently today.",

  "briefOverview": "A revelation directs specific leaders to leave Kirtland, settle debts, and gather to Missouri, emphasizing obedience over property and stewardship of sacred spaces.",
  "summary": "The Lord commands William Marks and Newel K. Whitney to quickly settle their affairs in Kirtland, repent of covetousness, and depart before winter, turning Kirtland properties toward debts and trusting God’s abundant provision. He contrasts their attachment to a “drop” with the greater prospects in Zion, specifically Adam-ondi-Ahman and the plains of Olaha Shinehah, and calls them to gather there. Marks is appointed to preside in Far West, with a promise that faithfulness over small things will lead to greater stewardship, and Whitney is called to serve as a bishop in Adam-ondi-Ahman and to reject the “Nicolaitane band.” The Lord honors Oliver Granger, assigning him to contend for the redemption of the First Presidency and promising that his sacrifice will be sacred and his name remembered, as he serves as a merchant for the benefit of the people. The revelation concludes by enjoining the Saints in Kirtland to remember the Lord and keep His house holy, with the assurance that moneychangers will be overthrown in God’s due time.",
  "externalContext": "In 1837–1838, the Latter-day Saints in Kirtland, Ohio, faced severe financial strain and internal dissension following banking failures and widespread economic downturns. Church leadership directed a general migration from Kirtland to Missouri, where stakes had been established at Far West (Caldwell County) and Adam-ondi-Ahman (Daviess County). Joseph Smith identified Adam-ondi-Ahman as a significant ancient site connected with Adam, intensifying the call to gather there. Outstanding debts related to Church operations and the Kirtland Temple required trusted agents to settle financial matters honorably as the body of Saints relocated.",
  "externalReferences": "The promise that one who is “faithful over a few things” will become “ruler over many” echoes Jesus’ parable of the talents (Matthew 25:21). The rebuke of the “Nicolaitane” recalls the Nicolaitans condemned in Revelation 2:6, 15. The charge to “overthrow the moneychangers” parallels Jesus’ cleansing of the temple (Matthew 21:12–13). Identifying Adam-ondi-Ahman as the land where Adam dwelt aligns with Doctrine and Covenants 116:1, while God’s claim over the creatures and resources of the world resonates with Psalm 50:10–12.",

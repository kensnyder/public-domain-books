  "chapterOsisID": "D&C.16",
  "briefOverview": "A revelation to “Peter” identifying the most valuable use of his life: to preach repentance and bring souls to Christ.",
  "summary": "Jesus Christ addresses “my servant Peter,” asserting divine authority and intimate knowledge of Peter’s private desires. The Lord commends Peter for seeking what is of greatest worth and for speaking God’s words according to commandment. He then answers Peter’s repeated question: the most worthwhile work is to declare repentance to the people so that souls may be brought to Christ. The promised outcome is shared rest with those souls in the kingdom of the Father.",
  "externalContext": "Latter-day Saint historical sources identify “Peter” here as Peter Whitmer Jr., and date this revelation to June 1829 in Fayette, New York, during the period of Book of Mormon translation. Many brief revelations in this period were given to close associates of Joseph Smith, often members of the Whitmer family, about their roles in the emerging movement. Doctrine and Covenants 15 and 16 are nearly identical, addressed respectively to John Whitmer and Peter Whitmer Jr., emphasizing personal calling toward preaching. Early Latter-day Saint culture placed strong emphasis on missionary labor as a primary expression of discipleship and service.",
  "externalReferences": "This passage closely parallels Doctrine and Covenants 15, offering the same answer about “that which is of the most worth.” It resonates with Doctrine and Covenants 6:9 and 11:9, where the Lord commands early disciples to “say nothing but repentance unto this generation,” and with Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–16, which extols the worth of souls and the joy of bringing even one soul to Christ. It also reflects the New Testament commission to proclaim repentance in Christ’s name (Luke 24:47) and the broader missionary mandate (Matthew 28:19–20).",

  "uncertainAreas": "The text does not explicitly identify “Peter” (historically understood as Peter Whitmer Jr.). The phrase “this people” is not defined, leaving its scope (local community or broader audience) open. The content of the private matter known only to Christ and Peter (v. 3) is undisclosed. The nature and timing of the promised “rest…in the kingdom of my Father” are not specified.",

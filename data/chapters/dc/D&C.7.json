  "briefOverview": "Christ grants John’s request to remain on earth and minister until His return, contrasting John’s desire with Peter’s, and bestows ministerial power and keys upon John, Peter, and James.",
  "summary": "John asks the Lord for power over death so he can live and bring souls to Christ, and the Lord promises he will tarry until Christ’s coming and prophesy to all nations. The Lord explains to Peter that, while Peter’s desire to quickly come to Christ’s kingdom is good, John chose a greater work by remaining to minister. John is made as a “flaming fire” and a “ministering angel” to serve those who are heirs of salvation on earth. Peter is appointed to minister for John and for James, and the three are given power and the keys of this ministry until Christ returns; both John and Peter will receive according to their righteous desires.",
  "externalContext": "In Latter-day Saint history, this section is dated to April 1829 during the period when Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were engaged in translating and receiving revelations. Early published headings described it as a revealed translation of a parchment written by John, addressing a long-standing Christian question from John 21 about whether John would remain on earth until Christ’s return. The text reflects early Restoration emphasis on apostolic authority, keys, and ongoing ministry. It also participates in a broader Christian discourse on translated or preserved figures who do not taste death, a theme historically applied to figures like Enoch and Elijah in biblical tradition.",
  "externalReferences": "This section explicitly interprets Jesus’s statement in John 21:20–23 (“If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?”), identifying John as the one who would remain until Christ’s return. The phrase “nations, kindreds, tongues and people” echoes Revelation 14:6, where an angel has the everlasting gospel to preach to all people. Descriptions of a “ministering angel” and being “as flaming fire” resonate with Psalm 104:4 (quoted in Hebrews 1:7) and Hebrews 1:14, which portray angels as ministering spirits serving the heirs of salvation. The bestowal of “keys” connects conceptually to Matthew 16:19, where Christ gives Peter the keys of the kingdom.",

    "What righteous desire would I ask of God if invited, and how might that shape my life’s work?",
    "How can I rejoice in others’ different callings without jealousy, as Peter is counseled to do?",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The phrase “I will make thee to minister for him and for thy brother James” could mean Peter ministers on behalf of John and James or in concert with them; the precise relational nuance is not fully clear from the text alone. The mechanics of John’s state (“power over death,” “tarry,” “ministering angel”) are not detailed, leaving ambiguity about the nature and mode of his ongoing ministry.",

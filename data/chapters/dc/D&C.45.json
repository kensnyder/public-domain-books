  "chapterOsisID": "D&C.45",
  "briefOverview": "A revelation in which Christ, speaking as Advocate and Lord of history, outlines signs preceding His coming, the gathering of Israel and Zion/New Jerusalem, and instructs the Saints to translate the New Testament and gather in unity.",
  "summary": "Christ calls His church to hearken to His voice as the Advocate who pleads for believers and as the Light of the world. He recounts prophecies paralleling His teachings to ancient disciples: Jerusalem’s desolation and scattering, the times of the Gentiles, widespread commotion, judgments, and heavenly signs before His return. Disciples are counseled to watch, stand in holy places, and recognize the approaching fulfillment like the budding fig tree. He describes His glorious coming, the resurrection of the saints, the Jews’ recognition of the crucified Jesus, the redemption of nations, and Satan’s binding, with the wise abiding the day as in the parable of the ten virgins. The faithful will inherit the earth under the Lord’s reign. The Saints are then directed to translate the New Testament to prepare for coming events, to gather from the East to the West, purchase an inheritance, and establish the New Jerusalem (Zion) as a refuge and city of peace. They are counseled to keep these plans from broad publicity until the Lord’s timing, while nations will ultimately fear the Lord’s power.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to early 1831 in Kirtland, Ohio, when Joseph Smith was engaged in his Bible translation (often called the Joseph Smith Translation) and the young church was organizing patterns of gathering. In the broader American context, the Second Great Awakening had heightened apocalyptic expectation and social reform, while westward expansion was accelerating. The prophecy about Jerusalem’s temple being thrown down recalls the Roman destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, which early Christians viewed as fulfillment of Jesus’ predictions. In subsequent revelations that year, Latter-day Saints were directed to identify a location for Zion in the American West, later specified as Jackson County, Missouri (Doctrine and Covenants 57).",
  "externalReferences": "Much of this chapter parallels the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24; Mark 13; Luke 21), including the destruction of the temple, the fig tree sign (Matthew 24:32–33), and the “times of the Gentiles” (Luke 21:24). The cosmic signs echo Joel 2:30–31 (cf. Acts 2:19–20), and the angelic trump and resurrection reflect 1 Thessalonians 4:16. The Jews’ question about the Messiah’s wounds recalls Zechariah 13:6, while the parable of the ten virgins is from Matthew 25:1–13. The language about Christ as Light and coming to His own echoes John 1:5, 11–12, and “strangers and pilgrims” reflects Hebrews 11:13; the reference to Enoch’s city resonates with Moses 7:18–21 in Latter-day Saint scripture.",

  "uncertainAreas": "“This place” for the remnant’s gathering (v.43) may refer to Jerusalem, but the chapter also speaks of a New Jerusalem in the West; the relationship between these locales is not fully specified here. The precise meaning and timing of “the times of the Gentiles” and the “overflowing scourge” are not defined. The instruction to keep plans from going abroad (v.72) raises questions about scope and duration. The phrase that children will “grow up without sin unto salvation” (v.58) invites questions about whether this is hyperbolic, covenantal protection, or millennial conditions.",

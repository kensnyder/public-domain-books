  "briefOverview": "A concise call to serve God wholeheartedly in a time of spiritual harvest, outlining the virtues that qualify a person for the work. It ends with a promise that seeking divine help will bring answers.",
  "summary": "The text announces that a marvelous work is imminent and summons those who desire to serve God to do so with full devotion. It teaches that anyone who desires to serve is called, because the spiritual harvest is ready, and diligent labor brings salvation to the worker’s soul. It identifies core qualifications—faith, hope, charity, love, and a single-minded focus on God’s glory—followed by a remembered catalog of virtues: faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, and diligence. It closes with a promise that those who ask and knock will receive and find access opened to them.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is traditionally dated to February 1829 in Harmony, Pennsylvania, addressed to Joseph Smith Sr., early in the Latter-day Saint movement before the church’s formal organization in 1830. Its agricultural imagery reflects a common biblical and early American rhetorical register, resonant in rural contexts. The passage has become a touchstone for missionary service and general Christian discipleship within the Latter-day Saint tradition, often memorized and quoted. Its language reflects King James Bible diction, characteristic of early nineteenth-century American religious texts and of the Doctrine and Covenants more broadly.",
  "externalReferences": "The phrase “a marvelous work” echoes Isaiah 29:14 (“a marvelous work and a wonder”). The call to love and serve God with one’s whole being aligns with Deuteronomy 6:5 and Jesus’ summary of the great commandment in Mark 12:30. The harvest imagery parallels Jesus’ words in John 4:35 about fields ready for harvest. The list of virtues resembles the progression in 2 Peter 1:5–7, and the closing promise of “ask … receive; knock … opened” reflects Matthew 7:7 and Luke 11:9.",

    "Where is the “harvest” in my current context, and how can I begin serving there today?",
    "What would it look like this week to serve God with all my heart, might, mind, and strength?",
    "Which listed virtue (faith, temperance, patience, etc.) most needs cultivation in my life right now, and what concrete step will I take?",
    "How can I keep an “eye single to the glory of God” amid competing motives or distractions?",

  "uncertainAreas": "The scope of “the work” could mean missionary proclamation specifically or broader service in God’s cause; the text does not delimit it. The phrase “he … perisheth not” may imply spiritual preservation, temporal well-being, or both. The relationship between “charity and love” listed together is not explicated, leaving open whether they are distinct nuances or intensifying parallels.",

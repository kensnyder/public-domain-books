  "briefOverview": "The Lord instructs Thomas (traditionally understood as Thomas B. Marsh) and the Twelve to be humble, united, and diligent in worldwide missionary work under divinely given keys. It warns of coming judgment beginning at the Lord’s house and emphasizes accountability and faithfulness.",
  "summary": "The Lord acknowledges Thomas’s prayers, notes prior displeasure, but forgives him upon his humility and commissions him to bear witness to Gentiles and Jews. He is to labor tirelessly, remain identified with Zion, and his words will humble the proud and lift the lowly. He is counseled to love without partiality, pray for and sharply admonish the Twelve, who, after tribulation, may be healed if they soften their hearts. All the Twelve are charged to take up the cross, follow Christ, feed His sheep, and not rebel against Joseph Smith; the Lord affirms His support of Joseph and that the keys remain with him until Christ comes. Thomas is appointed to hold the keys regarding the Twelve abroad, opening doors where the First Presidency cannot go; those sent by the Twelve, if humble and guided by the Spirit, will have power to open nations to the gospel. The Lord declares pervasive darkness and impending wrath that will begin at His own house, urging purification of hearts and universal preaching with baptism as the gate to salvation. He affirms that priesthood power and keys for the dispensation of the fulness of times have come down from the fathers, and calls the Twelve to cleanse themselves and be faithful until He comes with recompense.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is dated to July 1837 in Kirtland, Ohio, during a period of internal dissent and financial strain for early Latter-day Saints, including the collapse of the Kirtland Safety Society. Thomas B. Marsh then presided over the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who were developing their role as a traveling, missionary-focused quorum. That same summer marked the beginning of the Church’s first mission to Britain, signaling a major expansion of proselytizing efforts. Tensions over leadership loyalty and unity among Church officers form a backdrop to the revelation’s emphasis on humility, heeding Joseph Smith, and coordinated missionary work.",
  "externalReferences": "The commission to preach “into all the world” with belief and baptism echoes Mark 16:15–16. The calls to “take up your cross” and “follow me” recall teachings such as Mark 8:34, while “feed my sheep” parallels John 21:15–17. The statement that judgment begins at the Lord’s house resonates with 1 Peter 4:17, and the declaration “I come quickly … I am Alpha and Omega” reflects Revelation 22:12–13. The “dispensation of the fulness of times” aligns with Ephesians 1:10, and the imagery of darkness covering the earth parallels Isaiah 60:2.",

The specific individuals meant by those who have “blasphemed” in the Lord’s house are not named. The mechanics of how judgment “begins at my house,” and the precise meaning of being “converted” and “healed” after the Twelve’s tribulations, are not detailed. The phrase about keys coming down from the fathers is not fully specified as to which figures or transmissions are in view.",

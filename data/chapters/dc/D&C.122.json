  "briefOverview": "A divine message to Joseph Smith promises vindication and strength amid intense persecution, teaching that trials will yield experience and good.",
  "summary": "The Lord tells Joseph Smith that while some will mock him and hell will rage, the pure in heart will continually seek blessings under his hand, and his people will not be turned by traitors. Though opposition may lead to confinement and trouble for a small moment, God will honor him and make his voice formidable among enemies because of his righteousness, standing by him forever. A sweeping catalog of possible afflictions—false accusations, separation from family, imprisonment, threats of death, peril by land and sea, and even the seeming jaws of hell—is set in the context of God’s assurance that such things will give experience and be for his good. The Lord reminds him that the Son of Man descended below all things, inviting reflection on whether Joseph is greater than Christ. Therefore, Joseph is to hold his course without fear; the priesthood will remain with him, enemies’ bounds are fixed, his days are known, and God will be with him forever.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was given to Joseph Smith in March 1839 while he was imprisoned in Liberty Jail, Missouri, following the 1838 conflict between Latter-day Saints and Missouri settlers. Governor Lilburn Boggs’s “Extermination Order” (October 1838) had forced the Saints to leave Missouri, and Church leaders were arrested after surrendering at Far West. Conditions in Liberty Jail were harsh, and Joseph was separated from his family during winter months. The contents of Doctrine and Covenants 121–123 derive from letters Joseph wrote from the jail to Church members, later compiled and canonized.",
  "externalReferences": "The catalog of dangers, including “perils … among false brethren” and by “land or by sea,” echoes Paul’s list of sufferings in 2 Corinthians 11:26. The assurance that “all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good” resonates with Romans 8:28. The statement “The Son of Man hath descended below them all” parallels Doctrine and Covenants 88:6 and finds kinship with Philippians 2:6–8 and Hebrews 4:15, which emphasize Christ’s condescension and empathy. The idea that life’s span is fixed—“thy days are known … fear not what man can do”—recalls Job 14:5 and John 16:33’s promise of divine peace amid tribulation.",

    "How might I reframe present trials as experiences that can be for my good without minimizing their real pain?",
    "What practices help me “hold on [my] way” when opposition or slander feels overwhelming?",
    "How does Christ’s descent “below them all” inform how I seek His help in my own suffering?",
    "Where do I see God setting limits on harm in my life, and how can that lessen fear of what others may do?",
    "In what ways can I use my influence and authority to bless the pure in heart who seek counsel and support?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "“Their bounds are set, they cannot pass” likely refers to the limits God places on enemies, but the pronoun is ambiguous. The reference to an “elder son … six years of age” seems to fit Joseph Smith III at the time, but the text does not name him explicitly.",

  "briefOverview": "A brief revelation instructs the united order to receive Frederick G. Williams as a member and exhorts him to be diligent and faithful.",
  "summary": "The Lord commands the united order to admit Frederick G. Williams, adding that what is said to one applies to all. Williams is directed to be a lively (active and engaged) member of the order. He is promised enduring blessings if he remains faithful to prior commandments.",
  "externalContext": "In early 1830s Kirtland, Ohio, church leaders organized the United Order (often called the United Firm) to coordinate temporal affairs, including publishing, business, and welfare efforts among church members. Membership typically included leading figures responsible for managing resources for the community's benefit. Around this time, Frederick G. Williams had recently been called as a counselor to Joseph Smith, which increased his administrative responsibilities. This revelation fits within broader efforts to formalize leadership roles and shared stewardship over church temporal matters.",
  "externalReferences": "The “united order” referenced here builds on earlier revelations establishing and guiding the United Firm (Doctrine and Covenants 78:1–15; 82:11–24). The phrase “what I say unto one I say unto all” echoes a recurring doctrinal refrain in the Doctrine and Covenants (Doctrine and Covenants 82:5; 61:36). Williams’s inclusion follows his recent appointment as a counselor in the First Presidency (Doctrine and Covenants 90:6), aligning his ecclesiastical role with participation in the Church’s temporal stewardship body.",

  "chapterOsisID": "D&C.70",
  "briefOverview": "The Lord appoints specific leaders as stewards over revealed commandments and outlines how the material benefits of that stewardship should be handled. The chapter emphasizes accountability, consecration, equality in temporal matters, and proper support for those who administer spiritual things.",
  "summary": "The Lord addresses Joseph Smith Jr., Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, John Whitmer, Sidney Rigdon, and William W. Phelps, appointing them stewards over the revelations already given and those yet to be given, and requiring an account of their stewardship at judgment. Their business in the church is to manage these revelations and their associated concerns and benefits, while not giving these things to the church or the world; any surplus beyond their needs is to be placed in the Lord’s storehouse. The benefits are to be consecrated to Zion and its future generations as heirs of the kingdom. The Lord states that this stewardship model applies to everyone in the church, including bishops and agents, and affirms that those who administer spiritual things are worthy of their hire, while insisting on equality in temporal things without grudging. He promises blessings, security, and necessities (food, clothing, houses, lands) for the faithful stewards and assures them of His mercy and joy.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to 1831, a period when early Latter-day Saints organized efforts to publish Joseph Smith’s revelations in what would become the Book of Commandments. The individuals named here were central to editing, printing, and distributing church literature; together they formed what later came to be known as the Literary Firm. Early Latter-day Saint practice included the law of consecration, wherein members deeded property and received stewardships, with surplus going to the bishop’s storehouse to care for the poor and support church operations. Bishops and appointed agents administered these temporal affairs as part of building the community of Zion. The emphasis on accountability and equality reflects both practical community-building and theological commitments in the movement’s formative years.",
  "externalReferences": "The requirement that those who preach or administer spiritual things be supported echoes New Testament teachings such as Luke 10:7 (“the laborer is worthy of his hire”) and 1 Corinthians 9:13–14. The chapter’s insistence on equality in temporal things and consecrating surplus aligns with Doctrine and Covenants 42:30–34 (law of consecration) and with the bishop’s role and storehouse in Doctrine and Covenants 51:3–13 and 72:10–15. The language of stewardship and accountability resonates with 1 Corinthians 4:1–2, where stewards are required to be faithful. Later organizational developments related to church temporal management (e.g., Doctrine and Covenants 104) further systematize these principles.",

    "In what ways can a community foster temporal equality without grudging?",
    "How should those who teach and minister be appropriately supported while maintaining transparency and accountability?",
    "What would it look like to render an honest account of my stewardship—time, resources, or responsibilities—before God?",
    "How can organizational roles (spiritual and temporal) be structured to serve both immediate needs and future generations?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The phrase “they shall not give these things unto the church, neither unto the world” is contextually unclear; it likely concerns retaining control over publication rights and revenues, but the text does not state this explicitly. The statement that those administering spiritual things are “worthy of his hire, even more abundantly,” could refer to spiritual abundance rather than material support; the exact balance is not specified. The closing commendation (“they have done well inasmuch as they have not sinned”) is general and does not identify specific actions or limits, leaving room for interpretation.",

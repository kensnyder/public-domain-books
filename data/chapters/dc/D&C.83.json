  "briefOverview": "Outlines the church’s responsibility to provide for widows, orphans, and the poor, specifying claims upon family and the Lord’s storehouse. Clarifies conditions for fellowship and the role of consecrations in sustaining communal care.",
  "summary": "The revelation affirms that women have a claim upon their husbands for maintenance while their husbands live, and faithful women retain fellowship in the church. If a woman is not faithful, she is denied fellowship, yet she may remain on her legal inheritance according to civil law. Children likewise have a claim upon their parents for maintenance until they reach age. If parents cannot provide inheritances once children are of age, the children have a claim upon the church through the Lord’s storehouse. The storehouse is to be supported by the consecrations of the church, ensuring provision for widows, orphans, and the poor.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was given in early 1832 in Independence (Jackson County), Missouri, during a period when the early Latter-day Saint community was implementing the law of consecration and organizing storehouses to care for members in need. The United Firm (also called the United Order in some historical sources) managed church properties and storehouses to coordinate temporal stewardship. In 19th-century America, widows and children often faced economic vulnerability due to inheritance and property laws, making communal support systems particularly important. The revelation addresses these realities by assigning primary responsibility to family and secondarily to the church’s communal resources.",
  "externalReferences": "The text presupposes earlier instructions on consecration and the storehouse, especially Doctrine and Covenants 42:30–34, which establishes consecrating surplus and administering from a storehouse to the poor and needy. It also aligns with Doctrine and Covenants 78:3–7 concerning the establishment of storehouses and stewardship under the church’s leadership. New Testament emphases on caring for widows and orphans (James 1:27) and the early church’s organized care for widows (Acts 6:1–6) provide scriptural parallels to the welfare principles echoed here.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The exact historical dating and location are recalled from common Latter-day Saint sources (April 1832, Independence, Missouri) but not explicit in the chapter. The terms “not found transgressors” and “not faithful” are not defined here, leaving ambiguity about the scope of conduct that affects fellowship. The meaning of “inheritances” could denote property or stewardships and is not clarified. The age at which children are considered “of age” is not specified.",

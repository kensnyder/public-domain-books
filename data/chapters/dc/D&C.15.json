  "briefOverview": "A personal revelation to John affirming that his highest work is to preach repentance and bring souls to Christ.",
  "summary": "Jesus Christ addresses John, acknowledging divine knowledge of his private desires and commending him for speaking God’s words as commanded. John has repeatedly sought to know what would be of greatest worth to him. The Lord answers that the most valuable pursuit is to declare repentance to the people so that he may help bring souls to Christ and ultimately rest with them in the Father’s kingdom.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is historically associated with June 1829 in Fayette, New York, during the final phase of the Book of Mormon translation, when several members of the Whitmer family were closely involved with Joseph Smith. “John” is generally identified as John Whitmer, who later became one of the Eight Witnesses to the Book of Mormon and an early church historian. Early revelations in this period often personalized callings to preach repentance and gather converts, reflecting the movement’s missionary impulse in the American religious revivals of the early 19th century.",
  "externalReferences": "The directive to “declare repentance” parallels other early revelations, such as Doctrine and Covenants 11:9 (“Say nothing but repentance unto this generation”) and Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–16, which extols the worth of souls and the joy of bringing even one soul to Christ. The emphasis on preaching repentance also echoes the New Testament commission that repentance and remission of sins be preached in Christ’s name (Luke 24:47). A close Book of Mormon parallel appears in Alma 29:9, where Alma rejoices in being an instrument to bring souls to repentance; Doctrine and Covenants 16 provides an almost identical charge to Peter Whitmer Jr.",

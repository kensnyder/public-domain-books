  "briefOverview": "A revelation commissions John Murdock to preach the gospel in the eastern regions, promising divine power and outlining how people’s reception or rejection will be judged. It also instructs him to provide for his children before departing and notes a future inheritance in Zion or continued lifelong service.",
  "summary": "The Lord calls John Murdock to travel through the eastern countries, preaching from house to house amid persecution. Those who receive him receive Christ and will obtain mercy, while those who reject him will be rejected; he is to cleanse his feet privately as a testimony against rejecters. He will have power to declare the word through the Holy Spirit. The Lord affirms that He comes quickly to judgment to convict the ungodly, as written in the book. Murdock is told not to depart until his children are provided for and sent to the bishop of Zion. After some years he may go to inherit the goodly land, otherwise he is to continue preaching until his life’s end.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to the early 1830s, when the Latter-day Saint movement faced significant opposition in Ohio and Missouri. John Murdock was an early convert and experienced missionary whose wife died in 1831 after childbirth, leaving him with young children. “Zion” referred to the church’s designated gathering place in Jackson County, Missouri, where Bishop Edward Partridge oversaw temporal affairs under the law of consecration. Missionaries commonly traveled without purse or scrip, relying on hospitality while preaching across the northeastern and mid-Atlantic United States.",
  "externalReferences": "The promise “who receiveth you receiveth me” echoes Jesus’ words to His disciples (Matthew 10:40; Luke 10:16; John 13:20). The instruction to cleanse or shake off the dust of one’s feet as a testimony against rejecters reflects New Testament practice for missionaries (Matthew 10:14; Luke 9:5). The call to receive “as a little child” parallels Jesus’ teaching about childlike receptivity to the kingdom (Mark 10:15; Matthew 18:3). The phrase about coming to judgment to convict the ungodly closely resembles Jude 1:14–15, and “as it is written … in the volume of the book” echoes Psalm 40:7 and Hebrews 10:7.",

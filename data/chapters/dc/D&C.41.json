  "briefOverview": "The Lord calls church leaders to assemble to receive His law and sets immediate directives for governance and stewardship.",
  "summary": "The Lord commands the elders to assemble in faith so they may receive His law to govern the church, promising to come quickly and require that His law be kept. He distinguishes true disciples as those who receive and do His law, warning that the unfaithful will be cast out and that sacred things should not be given to the unworthy. Specific instructions are given to build a house for Joseph Smith Jr. to live and translate, and Sidney Rigdon is permitted to live as he chooses if he keeps the commandments. Edward Partridge is called and to be appointed by the voice of the church and ordained a bishop, leaving his business to devote himself to church labors and to oversee matters according to the forthcoming laws. The Lord commends Partridge’s purity, likening him to Nathanael of old, and concludes with a charge to regard these words seriously, as they will be accountable at judgment.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is dated to early February 1831 in Kirtland, Ohio, shortly after the church’s relocation from New York and the command to gather in Ohio (D&C 37–38). It immediately precedes the revelation known as “the law” (Doctrine and Covenants 42), which detailed church discipline, moral standards, and temporal stewardship. Edward Partridge, a convert from Ohio and a merchant by trade, became the first bishop in the Church of Christ (later The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). In this early period, bishops oversaw temporal affairs and would soon administer principles associated with consecration and care for the poor.",
  "externalReferences": "The warning against giving sacred things to the unworthy echoes Jesus’ teaching, “Do not cast your pearls before swine” (Matthew 7:6). The commendation of Edward Partridge as like “Nathanael… in whom is no guile” alludes to John 1:47. The promise “I come quickly” reflects language used in Revelation 22:12,20. The emphasis on doing rather than merely professing parallels Jesus’ teaching about doing the will of the Father (Matthew 7:21, 24–27).",

  "briefOverview": "A revelation commissions specific elders to preach by the Holy Ghost and establishes that inspired utterance is scripture, then delineates order for bishops, parental obligations in Zion, and warnings against idleness.",
  "summary": "The Lord calls Orson Hyde to proclaim the gospel, making his commission an example for all ordained to speak as moved by the Holy Ghost; such speech is declared to be scripture and the Lord’s will. He extends this charge to Luke Johnson, Lyman Johnson, William E. McLellin, and all faithful elders, to preach and baptize throughout the world, promising salvation to believers, condemnation to unbelievers, signs accompanying faith, knowledge of the signs of the times, and power to seal unto eternal life. The revelation then explains that additional bishops will be appointed: ordinarily worthy high priests designated by the First Presidency, unless a literal firstborn descendant of Aaron—properly designated, found worthy, and ordained—claims the legal right. If no such descendant is available, a high priest may serve as bishop when called and ordained by the First Presidency; bishops and high priests in this ministry are to be tried only before that Presidency, with forgiveness extended upon repentance. Parents in Zion and its organized stakes must teach children repentance, faith in Christ, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, ensuring baptism at eight years old and instructing them to pray and live uprightly; Sabbath observance is enjoined. The Lord rebukes idleness, greed, and neglect of eternal riches among the inhabitants of Zion, directs Oliver Cowdery to deliver these sayings, commands diligence in prayer, and concludes with a solemn warning not to transgress these true and faithful words.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was received on November 1, 1831, in Hiram, Ohio, during a conference where missionary assignments and church governance were active concerns. The named elders—Orson Hyde, Luke Johnson, Lyman Johnson, and William E. McLellin—were undertaking new preaching missions. “Zion” at this time referred to the church’s center in Jackson County, Missouri. The church’s first bishop, Edward Partridge, had been called earlier, and rapid expansion made instructions about additional bishops and disciplinary procedures practically important. Establishing baptism at age eight functioned as a standardized age of accountability for early Latter-day Saints, in contrast to infant baptism practiced in many Christian traditions of the day.",
  "externalReferences": "The missionary charge and promise of salvation with “signs following,” along with knowing the “signs of the times,” echo the New Testament Great Commission and eschatological teaching (Mark 16:15–18; Matthew 28:19; Matthew 24:3–14). The assertion that inspired speech is “scripture” parallels the claim that prophets spoke as they were “moved by the Holy Ghost” (2 Peter 1:21). The power to “seal” unto eternal life resonates with Jesus’ bestowal of binding authority to his apostles (Matthew 16:19). Teaching against infant baptism and fixing an age of accountability reflects Book of Mormon counsel on children’s innocence (Moroni 8:8–12); exhortations about Sabbath observance and avoiding idleness draw on longstanding biblical norms (Exodus 20:8–11; 2 Thessalonians 3:10).",

  "uncertainAreas": "The scope of “power to seal them up unto eternal life” is not defined here and can be interpreted variously within broader Latter-day Saint teachings. The identity of the “judge of my people” in verse 33 could refer to a bishop or another designated judge, but the text does not specify. The practical process for proving literal Aaronic lineage and the meaning of receiving such verification “by revelation” are not detailed. The nature and extent of “signs following” believers, and what counts as observing prayers “in the season thereof,” are not precisely delineated.",

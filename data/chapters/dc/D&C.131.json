  "briefOverview": "Joseph Smith teaches on degrees within celestial glory, the necessity of eternal marriage for the highest exaltation, the assurance called the \"more sure word of prophecy,\" the salvific role of knowledge, and the material nature of spirit.",
  "summary": "The chapter states that within the celestial glory are three degrees, and to obtain the highest, one must enter the order of the priesthood identified as the new and everlasting covenant of marriage; without it, one may inherit another degree but will not have increase. It defines the “more sure word of prophecy” as knowing, by revelation through priesthood power, that one is sealed up to eternal life. It asserts that salvation is incompatible with ignorance. It further teaches that spirit is not immaterial but a more refined form of matter, perceivable when bodies are purified.\n\nThe text thus links exaltation to covenantal marriage and sealing, emphasizes revealed assurance of eternal life, and affirms a physicalist view of spirit.",
  "externalContext": "These statements come from discourses Joseph Smith delivered in Nauvoo, Illinois, in May 1843, later compiled into the Doctrine and Covenants. During this period, teachings on temple ordinances and eternal marriage (including plural marriage, practiced privately then) were being articulated and systematized among Latter-day Saints. The idea of graded heavenly glories had been revealed earlier (1832), and by 1843 Joseph Smith was expanding on the celestial kingdom’s internal degrees and on sealing ordinances. Nauvoo theology also emphasized the tangibility of spirit and the eternal nature of intelligence and matter.",
  "externalReferences": "The three degrees within the celestial glory complement earlier revelations on the three kingdoms of glory generally (Doctrine and Covenants 76). The requirement of the “new and everlasting covenant of marriage” for the highest exaltation is elaborated in Doctrine and Covenants 132:19–24, which speaks of eternal marriage, continuation of seed, and exaltation. The “more sure word of prophecy” echoes 2 Peter 1:10–19, where calling and election and the prophetic word are discussed; LDS teachings often connect this with being “sealed up unto eternal life.” The materiality of spirit aligns with Doctrine and Covenants 93:33–34 and 88:15, which teach the relationship of spirit, element, body, and soul.",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "How do my commitments within marriage or preparation for it align with the text’s claims about exaltation?",
    "What practices help me seek revelation that confirms my standing with God without presumption?",
    "In what ways am I pursuing the knowledge necessary for salvation, and how can I deepen it responsibly?",
    "If spirit is a refined form of matter, how might that shape my view of embodiment, purity, and worship?",
    "How do I respond charitably to differing interpretations of “increase” and degrees of glory while staying true to the text?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "“He may enter into the other” likely refers to lower degrees within the celestial kingdom, but the text does not explicitly define which; “increase” plausibly means eternal posterity, yet the chapter does not specify. The scope of “ignorance” (general vs. saving knowledge) is also not defined.",

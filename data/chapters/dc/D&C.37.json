  "briefOverview": "A revelation redirects efforts from translating to relocating and strengthening the church, commanding a gathering to Ohio while honoring individual agency.",
  "summary": "The Lord instructs that translation work pause until Joseph and others go to Ohio, citing enemies and the saints’ welfare. Before leaving, they are to preach the gospel and strengthen existing congregations, especially in Colesville, whose members are praying in faith. The church as a whole is commanded to assemble in Ohio in anticipation of Oliver Cowdery’s return. The revelation concludes with a note of wisdom that each person may choose for himself until the Lord comes.\n\nThe focus is on strategic relocation, pastoral care for vulnerable branches, and a balance of commandment with personal choice.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is dated to December 1830, when early Latter-day Saints in New York faced legal and social harassment, notably among the Colesville converts. Around this time, Oliver Cowdery and companions were on a mission to Native Americans (“Lamanites”) and had recently passed through Kirtland, Ohio, where many, including members associated with Sidney Rigdon, joined the church. The directive to gather to Ohio anticipated consolidating a growing community in Kirtland. The “translation” referenced is generally understood to be Joseph Smith’s ongoing Bible translation (often called the Joseph Smith Translation).",
  "externalReferences": "Shortly before this, Sidney Rigdon was called to serve as a scribe for Joseph Smith’s translation (Doctrine & Covenants 35:20), which gives context to the command here to pause translation. Soon after, the gathering to Ohio is reiterated and explained in greater detail, with promises of divine protection and endowment (Doctrine & Covenants 38:31–33). The closing counsel about choosing for oneself resonates with broader teachings on moral agency (2 Nephi 2:27).",

  "uncertainAreas": "“Translate” is not specified; it is inferred to be the Bible translation. The identity of the “enemy” is unspecified. The phrase “let every man choose for himself” could refer to timing or willingness in gathering, but the degree of discretion is not explicit. The exact timeline implied by Oliver Cowdery’s “return” to them is not fully clear from this chapter alone.",

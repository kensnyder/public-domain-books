  "briefOverview": "Joseph F. Smith narrates a vision clarifying Christ’s ministry among the dead and the organized preaching of the gospel in the spirit world, grounding the Latter-day Saint practice of redemptive temple work.",
  "summary": "While pondering 1 Peter’s statements about Christ preaching to the spirits in prison, Joseph F. Smith sees in vision the hosts of the dead and the righteous awaiting the Savior’s visit. He beholds Christ appear to the faithful spirits, proclaiming liberty and teaching the doctrine of resurrection and redemption, but not personally visiting the wicked. He learns that, because Christ’s personal ministry there was brief, the Lord organized righteous messengers to preach the gospel—including faith, repentance, vicarious baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost—to all willing among the dead. Smith witnesses a vast assembly of ancient prophets (Adam, Eve, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Elijah, and others) and sees how Elijah’s mission relates to sealing and temple ordinances for the dead. He also sees modern leaders (Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff) continuing God’s work and learns that faithful elders of this dispensation preach the gospel after death. The dead who repent are redeemed through obedience to ordinances and receive rewards according to their works, and Smith bears testimony of the vision’s truth.",
  "externalContext": "The vision was received on October 3, 1918, by Joseph F. Smith, then president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, during a period marked by World War I and the global influenza pandemic, when questions about death and hope were urgent. Smith had suffered multiple family bereavements that year, intensifying his meditation on scriptural teachings about the dead. The account was circulated to church leaders and published later that year; it was formally added to the Latter-day Saint canon in 1976 and included in the Doctrine and Covenants in the 1981 edition. Latter-day Saint teaching on vicarious ordinances for the dead had been emphasized since the Nauvoo period, providing a doctrinal backdrop for the vision’s focus on temple work and sealing.",
  "externalReferences": "The vision is explicitly prompted by 1 Peter 3:18–20 and 1 Peter 4:6, which speak of Christ preaching to spirits in prison and the gospel being preached to the dead. Prophets named in the vision evoke passages such as Isaiah 61:1–2 (proclaiming liberty to captives), Ezekiel 37:1–14 (dry bones and resurrection), and Daniel 2:44 (God’s indestructible kingdom). References to “Elias” with Moses on the mount correspond to the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1–3), and the role of Elijah and sealing draws on Malachi 4:5–6, reiterated in Joseph Smith—History 1:36–39 and connected to the conferral of sealing keys in Doctrine and Covenants 110:13–16. The teaching about vicarious ordinances aligns with Latter-day Saint instructions on baptism for the dead in Doctrine and Covenants 127–128.",

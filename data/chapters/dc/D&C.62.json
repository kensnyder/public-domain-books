  "briefOverview": "Instruction and reassurance to traveling elders: proceed to Zion, assemble and partake of the sacrament, then return to testify as the Spirit directs.",
  "summary": "The Lord, identifying himself as the advocate who knows human weakness, addresses elders who have not yet reached Zion and tells them their mission is not complete. He blesses them, affirming that their testimonies are recorded in heaven and their sins forgiven. They are to continue to the land of Zion, hold a meeting, rejoice, and offer the sacrament; afterward they may return to bear record, either all together or two by two, as they choose, provided they are faithful. He promises preservation and rejoicing in Missouri to the faithful, allows flexibility in travel methods if received with gratitude, urges them to act according to judgment and the Spirit, and concludes with the assurance that the kingdom is theirs and he is with the faithful always.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to early August 1831, during the period when early Latter-day Saints were identifying Jackson County, Missouri, as the location of Zion and sending elders to and from that region. Travel on the American frontier was arduous; in nearby instructions (D&C 60–61), missionaries were cautioned about dangers on the waters, which made overland options salient. Missionary labor commonly involved traveling in pairs and preaching along the way, while also participating in gatherings and sacraments as the fledgling church established itself across Ohio and Missouri.",
  "externalReferences": "The permission to travel and preach “two by two” echoes Jesus sending disciples in pairs (Luke 10:1; cf. Mark 6:7). The statement that angels rejoice over their recorded testimonies recalls Jesus’ teaching that there is joy in heaven over the repentant (Luke 15:10), and is conceptually close to having names “written in heaven” (Luke 10:20). Christ identifying himself as “advocate” connects with 1 John 2:1, which names Jesus as our advocate with the Father, and his promise to be “with the faithful always” parallels Matthew 28:20 (“I am with you alway”).",

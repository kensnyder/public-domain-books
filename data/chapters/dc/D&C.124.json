  "briefOverview": "A revelation in Nauvoo directs the Saints to issue a worldwide proclamation, build the Nauvoo Temple and the Nauvoo House, regulate baptisms for the dead within a dedicated house, and delineates church leadership offices and assignments.",
  "summary": "The Lord instructs Joseph Smith to prepare a solemn proclamation of the gospel to rulers and nations and names associates to assist him. He commands the Saints to build the Nauvoo House as a boarding house for travelers and a temple where God will reveal ordinances long hidden, emphasizing that baptisms for the dead and other sacred washings and anointings belong to His house. The Lord grants a limited period during which proxy baptisms performed outside the temple will be accepted, warning that failure to build will bring rejection; He also affirms that when enemies hinder commanded work—as in Missouri—He accepts the Saints’ offerings and will judge the oppressors. Detailed directions are given for organizing and financing the Nauvoo House through stock, with strict stewardship conditions and named individuals invited to invest and labor. The revelation offers personal counsel and missions to Hyrum Smith, William Law, Sidney Rigdon, and others, including promises of spiritual gifts and protection conditioned on obedience. Finally, the Lord sets in order church governance: Hyrum Smith is appointed Patriarch (and to act as prophet, seer, and revelator with Joseph), William Law as counselor in the First Presidency, Brigham Young to preside over the Twelve, and other quorums and officers are named with their roles and keys.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is dated to January 1841 in Nauvoo, Illinois, after Latter-day Saints were expelled from Missouri (1838–39) and began building a new city on the Mississippi amid significant malaria and hardship. In late 1840 Illinois granted Nauvoo an expansive city charter, and leaders such as John C. Bennett helped secure political support for the community. Around this time Joseph Smith publicly taught baptism for the dead (notably in 1840), which early Saints began practicing provisionally in local rivers before a temple was available. The command to address the “president-elect” likely refers to William Henry Harrison, elected in November 1840 and inaugurated in March 1841. The revelation’s emphasis on constructing a temple fits broader 19th‑century Latter-day Saint efforts to establish sacred space after leaving Kirtland, Ohio.",
  "externalReferences": "The declaration that rulers are “as grass” and their glory “as the flower” echoes Isaiah 40:6–8 (cf. 1 Peter 1:24), and the promise to bear servants up “as on eagles’ wings” recalls Exodus 19:4. Authority to “bind” and “loose” and references to “keys” parallel Jesus’ words in Matthew 16:19, while the warning that iniquity is visited to the “third and fourth generation” alludes to Exodus 20:5. The mention of offerings by the “sons of Levi” resonates with Malachi 3:3, and the practice of baptism for the dead connects with Paul’s reference in 1 Corinthians 15:29, here situated within a temple framework.",

    "How might I participate in proclaiming the gospel widely, with both boldness and meekness?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The precise implications and timeframe of the warning that the church would be “rejected, with your dead” if the temple were not completed are debated; the revelation’s application to later historical developments requires care. The identification of the “president-elect” with William Henry Harrison is contextual but not explicit in the text. References to “memorials for your sacrifices by the sons of Levi” and their fulfillment in later practice involve interpretive questions about how ancient priestly imagery is applied in the Nauvoo temple setting.",

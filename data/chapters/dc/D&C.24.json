  "briefOverview": "Personal directives to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery define their ministerial focus, dependence on church support, and restraint in seeking miracles, coupled with promises of divine aid and warnings to those who reject them.",
  "summary": "The Lord reminds Joseph Smith of his calling and deliverance yet commands him to sin no more and to magnify his office. After securing his fields, he is to visit the churches in Colesville, Fayette, and Manchester, who are to support him; refusal will bring a curse rather than a blessing. Joseph is to pray, write by the Comforter, expound the scriptures, and devote his full service to Zion, enduring many afflictions with the Lord’s presence and focusing on spiritual duties rather than temporal labors, including confirming churches by laying on hands. Oliver Cowdery is to proclaim the gospel tirelessly with divine strength and glory in Christ, not himself. Miracles are not to be demanded except as commanded and when required by seekers, including casting out devils, healing, and protection from serpents and poisons, in order to fulfill what is written. If rejected, they are to shake off the dust as a testimony; those who attack them may be smitten in the Lord’s time, litigants will be cursed by the law, and the Lord directs them to travel without purse or extra provisions, relying on the church, as they prune the vineyard for the last time according to this pattern.\n",
  "externalContext": "Historically, this revelation is dated to July 1830 in Harmony, Pennsylvania, soon after the organization of the Church of Christ (later The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). Early congregations existed in upstate New York towns such as Colesville, Fayette, and Manchester, and the fledgling church faced social opposition and legal harassment. Itinerant ministry without purse or scrip reflects broader early American and biblical models of dependent, traveling preachers. The term “Zion” in early Latter-day Saint usage referred to the gathered, covenant community God intended to establish.",
  "externalReferences": "The instructions to take “no purse nor scrip,” to travel lightly, to rely on hospitality, and to shake off the dust when rejected echo Jesus’ missionary charge (Matthew 10:9–14; Luke 10:4–11). Promises and cautions about signs—casting out devils, healing the sick, and immunity to serpents and poisons—parallel New Testament passages (Mark 16:17–18; see also Acts 28:3–5 for protection from a viper). The assurance that words will be given “in the very moment” reflects Jesus’ promise to disciples under pressure (Matthew 10:19–20). The imagery of “pruning” the vineyard for the “last time” resonates with the allegory of the vineyard’s final labor in the Book of Mormon (Jacob 5:61–62), and the practice of laying on of hands to confirm believers reflects New Testament precedent (Acts 8:14–17).",

The phrase “cursed by the law” (v.17) and the mechanism of the Lord smiting aggressors “in [his] own due time” (v.16) are not specified. The extent to which protections from serpents and poisons are literal, conditional, or symbolic is not fully defined in the text.",

  "briefOverview": "A revelation to Oliver Cowdery on how personal revelation operates and on his divinely bestowed gifts, including the “gift of Aaron,” to obtain knowledge and assist with translating sacred records.",
  "summary": "The Lord promises Oliver Cowdery that he can receive knowledge of ancient records by asking in faith with an honest heart, and that such knowledge will be communicated to his mind and heart by the Holy Ghost. This process is identified as the spirit of revelation—the same power by which Moses led Israel through the Red Sea. Oliver is told this revelatory guidance is his gift and will deliver him from enemies if he keeps the commandments. He is also told he has another gift—the “gift of Aaron”—a God-given power that he will hold in his hands to do marvelous works and to receive answers through it. He is counseled not to trifle, but to ask in faith for the mysteries of God and for power to translate and learn from hidden ancient records, which will be granted according to his faith.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is dated to April 1829 during the early phase of translating the Book of Mormon, when Oliver Cowdery had recently become Joseph Smith’s principal scribe. Oliver expressed a desire to translate, and several revelations in this period addressed how revelation and translation functioned. Early textual history indicates that language later rendered as the “gift of Aaron” was originally associated with a “rod,” reflecting an instrument Oliver used for divine guidance; in 19th-century America, divining rods were sometimes employed in folk-religious contexts, though here the gift is framed as God’s power rather than mere folk practice.",
  "externalReferences": "The text explicitly links the “spirit of revelation” to Moses parting the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21–22), grounding Oliver’s promised guidance in the biblical paradigm of divine deliverance. The title “gift of Aaron” evokes Aaron’s rod used before Pharaoh (Exodus 7:10–12) and the rod that budded as a sign of divine choice (Numbers 17:8), suggesting an authorized, God-empowered instrument. The exhortation to ask in faith echoes the biblical counsel of James 1:5–6 to ask God without doubting. Instruction that the Holy Ghost communicates truth to the mind and heart resonates with New Testament teaching that the Spirit teaches and brings understanding (John 14:26).",

The extent to which this revelation authorized Oliver to translate immediately, or conditionally based on faith, is clarified more fully by related revelations (e.g., D&C 9).",

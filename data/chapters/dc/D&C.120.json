  "briefOverview": "Establishes a governing council to decide how Church resources are to be disposed and affirms that such decisions are to be guided by the Lord’s voice.",
  "summary": "The Lord declares that decisions about what is to be disposed will be made by a council consisting of the First Presidency, the bishop and his council, and the high council. He adds that His own voice will direct them in this work. The revelation closes with an affirmation, “Even so. Amen.”",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was recorded in July 1838 in Far West, Missouri, shortly after a related instruction on tithing (Doctrine and Covenants 119). In early Latter-day Saint practice, bishops oversaw storehouses and temporal affairs, while high councils and the First Presidency provided governance and adjudication. Over time, the Church developed a formal “Council on the Disposition of the Tithes,” reflecting the principle here that temporal resources should be allocated by senior leaders seeking divine direction.",
  "externalReferences": "This instruction follows naturally after Doctrine and Covenants 119, which defines tithing and sets expectations for member contributions. Doctrine and Covenants 107 outlines the roles of the First Presidency and high councils, providing a framework for councils making authoritative decisions. Earlier revelations concerning the bishop’s stewardship over temporal affairs and the storehouse (e.g., Doctrine and Covenants 42; 51; 72; 85) form background for why a bishop and his council would be involved in resource disposition.",

    "How can decision-making bodies today combine responsible stewardship with seeking divine guidance?",
    "What safeguards and processes help councils steward shared resources transparently and fairly?",
    "How do I personally prepare to participate in councils so that collective decisions can be influenced by the Lord’s voice?",
    "In what ways can temporal administration be conducted as a spiritual undertaking rather than a merely procedural one?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The antecedent of “it” is unstated in the text (likely funds/resources, given context). The precise identity of the “high council” and whether “the bishop and his council” refers to a presiding or local bishopric in this setting is not explicit. The manner in which the Lord’s voice is to be made known to the council is also unspecified.",

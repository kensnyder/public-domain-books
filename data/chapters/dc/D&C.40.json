  "briefOverview": "A brief revelation explains why James Covill, though initially receptive and covenanting to obey, ultimately rejected the word due to fear and worldly concerns.",
  "summary": "The Lord states that James Covill’s heart was initially right, and he covenanted to obey God’s word. He received the message gladly, but Satan quickly tempted him. Fear of persecution and the cares of the world led him to reject the word and break his covenant. God concludes that judgment regarding Covill rests with Him.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to early 1831, during a period when Joseph Smith and early Latter-day Saints in New York were preparing for a major relocation to Ohio. James Covill has traditionally been identified as a Methodist minister who expressed interest in the Latter-day Saint message, though some scholarship notes uncertainty about his precise identity and background. Early converts often faced social and ecclesiastical pressures, and fear of opposition was a tangible factor in religious decisions at the time.",
  "externalReferences": "This section follows directly on Doctrine and Covenants 39, a revelation addressed to James Covill inviting him to repent, be baptized, and gather with the Saints. The language of receiving the word “with gladness” but falling away due to persecution and “cares of the world” parallels the Parable of the Sower (Mark 4:16–19; cf. Matthew 13:20–22). The theme of fearing people rather than God echoes Proverbs 29:25 and resonates with an earlier Latter-day Saint rebuke in Doctrine and Covenants 3:7–8 about fearing man more than God.",

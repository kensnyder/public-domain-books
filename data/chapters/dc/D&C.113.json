  "briefOverview": "A revealed Q&A interprets Isaiah 11 and 52, identifying the Stem of Jesse as Christ and describing latter-day figures and Zion’s empowerment through priesthood authority.",
  "summary": "The text answers questions about Isaiah 11, declaring that the “Stem of Jesse” is Christ. The “rod” is described as a servant in Christ’s hands, partly of Jesse and of Ephraim (house of Joseph), endowed with great power. The “root of Jesse” is a descendant of Jesse and Joseph to whom belong priesthood authority and “the keys of the kingdom,” serving as an ensign to gather God’s people in the last days. Addressing Isaiah 52:1, it explains that Zion’s “strength” is the authority of the priesthood, to be exercised by those called in the last days and claimed by Zion through lineage. On Isaiah 52:2, it teaches that scattered remnants of Israel are urged to return to the Lord, upon which He will speak to them (give revelation); their “bands” are the divine curses accompanying their scattered state among the Gentiles.",
  "externalContext": "Doctrine and Covenants is a collection of revelations received by Joseph Smith, a foundational text for the Latter-day Saint movement. Section 113 was produced in 1838 at Far West, Missouri, in a period when Latter-day Saints emphasized the gathering of Israel and the establishment of Zion amid significant social and political pressures. The Q&A format reflects Smith’s pattern of responding to specific scriptural inquiries from associates; verse 7 notes a question by Elias Higbee, a church leader in Missouri. Ideas of priesthood authority and “keys” were central to early Latter-day Saint ecclesiology, shaping governance and missionary gathering efforts.",
  "externalReferences": "The passage interprets Isaiah 11:1–5 and 11:10, and implicitly aligns with Isaiah 11:12 on an “ensign” for gathering the nations. It also cites Isaiah 52:1–2 and points readers to Isaiah 52:6–8 for the promise that the Lord will speak to returning Israel. The mention of Jesse recalls 1 Samuel 16:1 (Jesse as David’s father), and Paul cites Isaiah 11:10 in Romans 15:12 regarding the “root of Jesse.” The phrase “keys of the kingdom” echoes Matthew 16:19, where authority to bind and loose is discussed, paralleling the text’s emphasis on priesthood keys.",

    "How might a faith community today “put on strength” by exercising divinely delegated authority with integrity and humility?",
    "In what ways can individuals and communities participate in the gathering and redemption of God’s people where they live?",
    "What practices help us “return to the Lord” so that we are more receptive to revelation?",

    "Where do we see figurative “bands” (curses or constraints) in our lives and communities, and what faithful steps loosen them?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The specific identities of the “rod” and the “root of Jesse” are not named; the text gives lineage and role descriptors but leaves the person(s) unspecified. The scope of “Zion’s” lineage-based right to priesthood authority and how it applies across groups may be interpreted variously.",

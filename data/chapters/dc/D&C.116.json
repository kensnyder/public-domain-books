  "briefOverview": "A place in Missouri is identified as Adam-ondi-Ahman, foretold as the future site of Adam (the Ancient of Days) visiting his people.",
  "summary": "The Lord designates Spring Hill as Adam-ondi-Ahman, declaring it the prophesied location where Adam—the Ancient of Days mentioned by Daniel—will come to visit his people and sit in assembly. The verse links a specific geographic site to an eschatological event referenced in Daniel.",
  "externalContext": "This text dates to 1838 during the Latter-day Saints’ Missouri period, when Church members were settling in and around Far West and Daviess County. Joseph Smith and early Saints established a community at Adam-ondi-Ahman that summer, viewing it as a sacred location tied to primeval and future events. Growing tension between Missourians and the Saints culminated later in 1838 in conflict and expulsion, but the site’s religious significance persisted in Latter-day Saint memory and teaching.",
  "externalReferences": "Daniel 7:9–14 describes the “Ancient of Days” seated in judgment and the Son of Man receiving dominion; D&C 116 applies that title to Adam and identifies the future setting as Adam-ondi-Ahman. D&C 27:11 explicitly equates Michael/Adam with the “Ancient of Days,” reinforcing the identification assumed in this verse. D&C 107:53–57 recounts an ancient gathering where Adam blessed his posterity at the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, providing a precedent for sacred assemblies at this location.",

    "How does associating specific places with sacred history shape a community’s identity and hopes?",
    "What implications follow from identifying the Ancient of Days in Daniel as Adam rather than God the Father?",
    "How might expectations about future sacred assemblies influence present discipleship and preparation?",
    "What responsibilities accompany regarding a location as sacred, especially amid social and political tensions?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text does not specify the timing or detailed nature of the future gathering, nor does it clarify how Daniel’s vision maps onto the logistics of the prophesied event beyond identifying the site. Historical boundaries and the precise extent of “Spring Hill” as intended here may also be debated.",

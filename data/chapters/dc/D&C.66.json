  "briefOverview": "A personal revelation to William E. McLellin commissions him to preach the gospel, counsels repentance and moral integrity, and promises divine aid and eternal reward.",
  "summary": "The Lord blesses William E. McLellin for receiving the gospel and turning from iniquity, yet calls him to further repentance where needed. He is directed to preach the gospel broadly, especially in the eastern regions, delaying any journey to Zion and not being preoccupied with property. He is to travel with Samuel H. Smith, teach in public religious settings, heal the sick by laying on hands, and rely on the Lord through prayerful asking and patient endurance. The Lord warns him to avoid being encumbered, forsake unrighteousness, and specifically resist adultery, a temptation for him. If he keeps these commandments and magnifies his office, he will help gather many to Zion and receive a crown of eternal life. The revelation closes with Jesus Christ identifying himself as the speaker.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to October 1831, during a period of rapid expansion and missionary activity in the early Latter-day Saint movement centered in Ohio and surrounding states. That same year, Jackson County, Missouri, had been identified by church leaders as the location of “Zion,” prompting many to consider relocating there, though this text instructs McLellin to delay. William E. McLellin had recently joined the church and sought divine guidance about his life and service. Samuel H. Smith, an early convert and brother of Joseph Smith, frequently served as a traveling missionary, making their companionship a practical pairing for evangelistic work in the northeastern United States.",
  "externalReferences": "“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you” closely echoes Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 7:7 and Luke 11:9. The promise that laying hands on the sick leads to recovery reflects Mark 16:18 and early Christian healing practices. The phrase “songs of everlasting joy upon their heads” parallels Isaiah 35:10, a passage about redeemed people returning to Zion with joy. The “everlasting covenant” language resonates with Isaiah 55:3 and Hebrews 13:20, where God’s enduring covenant relationship is emphasized.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The text does not specify which sins remained for McLellin to address or the exact nature of the property concerns. The reference to speaking in “synagogues” may be a general term for religious assemblies rather than Jewish synagogues in 1831 America. The phrase “push many people to Zion” could imply physical gathering to Missouri or spiritual preparation; the scope is not explicit.",

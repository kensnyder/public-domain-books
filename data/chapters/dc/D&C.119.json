  "briefOverview": "The revelation establishes a binding law of tithing, beginning with surplus property and continuing with an annual payment of one-tenth, to fund sacred purposes and sanctify Zion.",
  "summary": "The Lord requires the Saints’ surplus property to be placed in the bishop’s hands to build His house, support Zion’s foundations and priesthood, and address Church leadership debts. This marks the beginning of tithing: thereafter, those who have thus been tithed are to pay one-tenth of their annual “interest” as a perpetual law. Those gathering to the land of Zion must be tithed of their surplus and keep this law or they will not be worthy to remain. If the people fail to keep the law to sanctify the land, it will not be Zion to them. This instruction is an example for all the stakes of Zion.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was given in July 1838 in Far West, Missouri, a period when the Church faced significant financial strain following prior economic difficulties and the costly effort to establish communities and build temples. In earlier Latter-day Saint practice, the “law of consecration” involved deeding property to the bishop for redistribution and Church needs. Far West had recently been designated as a key center for the Saints, with plans to build a temple there. In 19th-century American usage, the term “interest” commonly referred to one’s annual increase or income, shaping how tithing was often understood.",
  "externalReferences": "The requirement to pay tithes resonates with Malachi 3:8–10, which calls Israel to bring tithes into the storehouse so there may be “meat” in God’s house. The direction to place surplus property with the bishop stands in continuity with the law of consecration outlined in Doctrine and Covenants 42:30–38. The mandate to fund the Lord’s house aligns with the earlier command to build a temple in Far West (Doctrine and Covenants 115:7–16). Immediately following this revelation, Doctrine and Covenants 120 designates a council to direct the disposition of tithes, and Doctrine and Covenants 64:23–25 earlier ties tithing to covenantal protection and obedience.",

    "How do I define my “surplus” and “annual interest” in a way that is honest and consistent before God?",
    "In what ways can my tithing directly support the building of God’s work in my community?",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The precise calculation of “surplus property” and “one-tenth of all their interest annually” is not defined in the text and may depend on contemporary interpretation. It is not entirely clear whether the initial surplus requirement applies universally or specifically to those gathering to the “land of Zion” at that time. The phrase “not be found worthy to abide among you” leaves unspecified the process or consequences for noncompliance. The scope of “forever” as a standing law is stated, but the text does not address how it interfaces with changing economic conditions or administrative practices.",

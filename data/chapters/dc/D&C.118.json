  "briefOverview": "The revelation reorganizes the Quorum of the Twelve and commissions them to preach abroad, promising divine provision and setting a specific time and place for their departure.",
  "summary": "The Lord commands that a conference be held to organize the Twelve and appoint replacements for those who have fallen. Thomas is to remain in Zion temporarily to publish the Lord’s word, while the rest continue preaching with humility, receiving the promise that the Lord will provide for their families and open an effectual door. The Twelve are instructed to depart the following spring to cross the great waters and proclaim the fulness of the gospel, bearing witness of Christ’s name. They are to take leave of the Saints at Far West on April 26, at the designated site of the Lord’s house. John Taylor, John E. Page, Wilford Woodruff, and Willard Richards are named to fill vacancies in the Twelve and are to be officially notified.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was received in July 1838 in Far West, Missouri, during a period of internal dissension and rising conflict with local Missourians. Several original members of the Quorum of the Twelve had been excommunicated or had left the church by this time, necessitating new appointments. Thomas B. Marsh was then serving as president of the Twelve. The instruction to cross “the great waters” anticipated the British mission beginning in 1839, where the Twelve oversaw significant growth through preaching in England and surrounding areas. The “building-spot of my house” refers to the Far West temple site, where cornerstones had been laid earlier in 1838.",
  "externalReferences": "The role and authority of the Twelve are earlier defined in Doctrine and Covenants 107, providing a foundation for this reorganization. Doctrine and Covenants 112 (to Thomas B. Marsh) and 114 (April 1838) both speak of the Twelve going among the nations and preparing to depart the next spring, directly echoed here. Doctrine and Covenants 115 identifies Far West as a central gathering place and designates a temple site, which aligns with the instruction to meet on the “building-spot” for leave-taking. The phrase “an effectual door” recalls New Testament language about God opening a door for ministry (1 Corinthians 16:9; 2 Corinthians 2:12; cf. Colossians 4:3).",

  "uncertainAreas": "“Thomas” is almost certainly Thomas B. Marsh, but the text does not specify his surname. The identity of all individuals implied by “those who are fallen” is not named here. The chapter presumes but does not state the exact date and location (Far West, July 1838), which I supplied from standard historical context.",

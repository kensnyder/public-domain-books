  "briefOverview": "The revelation clarifies who may receive binding commandments for the church and assigns Oliver Cowdery to preach to the Lamanites while helping set church affairs in order. It addresses false revelations and emphasizes governance by common consent.",
  "summary": "Oliver Cowdery is assured that he will be heard when he teaches by the Holy Ghost, but the authority to receive commandments and revelations for the church is reserved to Joseph Smith, who is likened to Moses, with Oliver in an Aaron-like supporting role. Oliver may teach by the Comforter but is not to write “by way of commandment” or direct the one at the head of the church, since Joseph holds the keys. He is called to preach to the Lamanites and establish the church among them if they receive the message, with the note that the location of Zion is not yet revealed, though it will be on the borders by the Lamanites. He is to remain for the upcoming conference over which Joseph will preside, and then privately correct Hiram Page, whose revelations from a stone are declared deceptive and unauthorized. The revelation reiterates that church matters must proceed in order and by common consent and that Oliver should help settle these issues before departing on his mission, declaring the gospel with rejoicing.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to September 1830 in the early months of the Church of Christ (later The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). A dispute had arisen when Hiram Page claimed revelations via a seer stone about church governance and the location of Zion, influencing some members. The instruction to preach to the “Lamanites” led to a mission to Native American tribes in territories west of Missouri, then commonly referred to by U.S. authorities as the Indian Territory. The phrase “borders by the Lamanites” reflected contemporary geography at the western edge of Missouri. In 1831, Independence, Missouri, would later be designated as the center place of Zion in subsequent revelations.",
  "externalReferences": "Joseph Smith’s exclusive role in receiving commandments for the church is reinforced elsewhere (Doctrine and Covenants 43:1–7). The comparison of Joseph to Moses and Oliver to Aaron echoes the biblical pattern of prophetic leadership and spokesman (Exodus 4:14–16; Numbers 12:6–8). The promise that the Comforter will teach and guide aligns with Jesus’ teaching about the Holy Ghost (John 14:26). Governance “by common consent” accords with other early organizational instructions (Doctrine and Covenants 26:2; 20:65), and the later identification of Zion’s center place in Missouri appears in Doctrine and Covenants 57:1–3.",

The reference to “sealed” revelations given to Joseph is not elaborated in this chapter.",

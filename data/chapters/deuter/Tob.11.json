  "briefOverview": "Tobias returns to Nineveh, heals Tobit’s blindness with the fish’s gall, and the family publicly praises God as they celebrate Tobias and Sarah’s marriage.",
  "summary": "Guided by Raphael, Tobias hastens home ahead of Sarah to prepare the house and to heal his father. Anna spots the travelers and runs to meet her son, while Tobit, still blind, comes to the door. Tobias applies the fish’s gall to Tobit’s eyes; the stinging causes the white film to peel away, and Tobit’s sight is restored. Tobit blesses God and his holy angels, acknowledging both God’s discipline and mercy, and rejoices to see his son. The family welcomes Sarah, praises God before onlookers who marvel at Tobit’s recovery, and keeps a seven-day wedding celebration with relatives, including Achiacharus and Nasbas.",
  "externalContext": "The narrative is set during the Assyrian period, with Nineveh—the Assyrian capital—as the family’s city. Jewish communities lived in exile across Assyrian-controlled regions, including Media, which explains travel between places like Ecbatana and Nineveh. Public thanksgiving and blessing language were common features of ancient Israelite piety, especially after deliverance or healing. Week-long wedding feasts were a recognized ancient Near Eastern custom, reflected in several biblical narratives.",
  "externalReferences": "The healing here fulfills earlier directions in the book that the fish’s gall would restore Tobit’s sight (Tobit 6:7–9) and presupposes Tobit’s blindness recounted earlier (Tobit 2:10–11). The seven-day wedding celebration aligns with other biblical depictions of week-long marriage feasts (Judges 14:12; Genesis 29:27). Tobit’s blessing that includes God’s angels resonates with calls for angelic praise in Scripture (Psalm 103:20–21), and his acknowledgment that God both disciplines and shows mercy parallels statements about God wounding and healing (Job 5:18).",

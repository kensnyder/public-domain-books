  "chapterOsisID": "Sir.14",
  "briefOverview": "Exhortations contrast the self-destructive greed of the “evil eye” with generous, timely enjoyment of God’s gifts and the pursuit of wisdom that shelters and honors its seeker.",
  "summary": "The chapter blesses those who avoid sin through speech and who maintain hope, then denounces greed, stinginess, and the “evil eye” as self-harming and insatiable. It urges readers to do good for themselves, offer fitting gifts to God, and practice generosity toward friends and the poor while life endures. Remembering the nearness of death, it warns against hoarding and postponing good deeds. All flesh withers like grass; corruptible works fail, but excellent work is vindicated and brings honor to its worker. The chapter concludes by praising those who abide in Wisdom, actively seeking her, dwelling near her, and finding protection and rest under her covering.",
  "externalContext": "Sirach (Ecclesiasticus) is a Jewish wisdom text composed in Hebrew by Jesus ben Sira in early second-century BCE Jerusalem and translated into Greek by his grandson. It reflects the sapiential tradition that links piety, ethical conduct, and prudent use of wealth. In Jewish idiom, an “evil eye” commonly denotes envy or miserly greed. Ben Sira also assumes a Temple-centered piety in which offerings and almsgiving express reverence toward God. The mortality language reflects widespread ancient Near Eastern and biblical perspectives on death and Sheol as the inevitable end that should shape present conduct.",
  "externalReferences": "The warning about the “evil eye” and haste for wealth echoes Proverbs 28:22 and the caution against eating with a stingy man in Proverbs 23:6–7. The call to enjoy one’s goods and do good before death parallels Ecclesiastes 9:7–10 and the observation that wealth amassed may be left for others in Ecclesiastes 2:18–21. The imagery of human life as grass parallels Isaiah 40:6–8 and Psalm 103:15–16. Wisdom personified as a woman who shelters and honors those who seek her aligns with Proverbs 8 and Proverbs 3:13–18; almsgiving themes resonate with Tobit 4:7–11.",

    "Where am I withholding good that I could share now with friends or the poor?",
    "How does my approach to money reveal either a generous or an “evil eye” posture?",
    "What practices help me remember mortality in ways that prompt timely, just action?",
    "How can I concretely pursue and ‘dwell with’ wisdom in my routines and relationships?",
    "Which of my works are truly excellent and enduring, and which are merely corruptible?",
    "Do my words safeguard me from causing offense, or do they undermine hope and peace?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The precise nuance of “justify your soul” and “every excellent work will be justified” is ambiguous (vindicated by God or socially honored). The phrase “covenant of the grave” is idiomatic and its scope is unclear. The boundaries between chapters 14 and 15 in some traditions may shift the final verses’ placement. The full semantic range of “evil eye” may include both envy and stinginess.",

  "chapterOsisID": "Wis.9",
  "briefOverview": "A royal prayer asks God to grant Wisdom for just rule and right judgment. It emphasizes human limits and the necessity of divine Wisdom and Spirit to know God’s will.",
  "summary": "The speaker addresses the Creator as the God of the ancestors, acknowledging that God made all things by his word and established humanity to rule with equity and justice. He petitions for Wisdom, who sits by God’s throne, confessing his own weakness and inadequacy to judge and govern without her. Charged with kingship and the building of the temple, he seeks Wisdom to guide his actions so his works will be acceptable and his judgments righteous. Wisdom is described as present with God at creation, knowing God’s works and what pleases him. The prayer contrasts human frailty and confusion with the clarity that comes from God’s Wisdom and the Holy Spirit sent from above. It concludes that through this divine gift, human ways are reformed, people learn what pleases God, and are saved through Wisdom.",
  "externalContext": "Traditionally attributed to Solomon, the book is widely understood by scholars to be a Hellenistic Jewish work, likely composed in Greek in Alexandria between the late first century BCE and early first century CE. It uses the royal persona of Solomon to reflect on kingship, justice, and divine Wisdom. The chapter’s temple references evoke Solomon’s building of the First Temple in Jerusalem, a central act of Israel’s royal theology. Personified Wisdom (Sophia) reflects both Israelite sapiential tradition and engagement with Hellenistic philosophical ideas about a divine ordering principle.",
  "externalReferences": "The prayer’s setting and themes recall Solomon’s request for wisdom to rule (1 Kings 3:5–12) and his commission to build the temple (1 Kings 6–8). The portrayal of Wisdom as present at creation echoes Proverbs 8:22–31, while creation by God’s word recalls Genesis 1:1–3. The rhetorical question, “Who has known the counsel of God?” parallels Isaiah 40:13, later cited in Romans 11:34 and 1 Corinthians 2:16. The petition for the Spirit from above resonates with depictions of the Spirit of the Lord imparting wisdom (Isaiah 11:2).",

  "uncertainAreas": "Whether “son of thine handmaid” signals a specific historical reference (e.g., to Bathsheba) or is a general expression of humility; the precise nuance of “Holy Spirit” in this text versus later theological developments; and the degree to which the prayer should be read strictly as Solomon’s voice versus a literary persona of a later Hellenistic Jewish author.",

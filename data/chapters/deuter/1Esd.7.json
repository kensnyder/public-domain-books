  "briefOverview": "The Second Temple is completed and dedicated, and the returned exiles celebrate Passover and Unleavened Bread with joy under Persian support.",
  "summary": "Persian officials Sisinnes and Sathrabuzanes carefully oversee and assist the rebuilding in obedience to King Darius, while the prophets Haggai and Zechariah encourage the work. By the command of the God of Israel, and with the consent of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, the holy house is finished on the 23rd of Adar in Darius’s sixth year. Israel, with priests and Levites, dedicates the temple with prescribed offerings, including twelve goats as a sin offering for all Israel. Priests and Levites serve in their vestments according to the book of Moses, and gatekeepers stand at their posts. After sanctification, the community keeps Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month; the Levites, sanctified together, offer the Passover for all the returnees, for the priests, and for themselves. Those who had separated from the abominations of the people of the land join in, and the feast of Unleavened Bread is kept seven days with gladness, because God turned the counsel of the “king of Assyria” toward them to strengthen their hands in God’s work.",
  "externalContext": "These events correspond to the early Persian period under Darius I (reigned 522–486 BCE), during which imperial policy often supported local cults to stabilize the provinces. The sixth year of Darius is commonly dated to 515 BCE, the traditional date for the Second Temple’s completion. Haggai and Zechariah prophesied in 520–518 BCE to motivate the stalled rebuilding efforts. References to Celosyria and Phoenicia reflect Persian administrative regions west of the Euphrates. Adar is the twelfth month of the Hebrew calendar, placing the completion shortly before Passover in the first month (Nisan).",
  "externalReferences": "This account parallels Ezra 6:13–22, including the completion date, the dedication offerings, and the celebration of Passover and Unleavened Bread. The mention of prophetic encouragement reflects the ministry of Haggai (Haggai 1–2) and Zechariah (e.g., Zechariah 4:6–10). The Passover observance follows Mosaic instructions (Exodus 12:1–14; Leviticus 23:4–8), and the Levites’ role in offering for others recalls a precedent in 2 Chronicles 30:15–17. The phrase “king of Assyria” for a Persian monarch matches Ezra 6:22, using an older imperial title for the ruler over that territory.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The identification of the “king of Assyria” likely refers to the Persian king (as in Ezra 6:22), but the phrasing is historically layered. The inclusion of Artaxerxes in the list of supportive kings, though the temple finished under Darius, may be a summarizing formula. The extent of the Levites’ role in offering on behalf of priests and all the returnees invites comparison to other passages but is not fully explained here. The precise identity of those who “separated themselves from the abominations of the people of the land” is not defined in this chapter.",

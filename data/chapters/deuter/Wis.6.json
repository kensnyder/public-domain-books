  "chapterOsisID": "Wis.6",
  "briefOverview": "A warning to rulers that their authority comes from God and will be judged, followed by an invitation to seek Wisdom, who grants stability, holiness, and enduring rule.",
  "summary": "The chapter addresses kings and judges, reminding them that their power is from the Most High who will scrutinize their deeds and motives, showing no partiality and imposing a stricter judgment on the mighty. Because they have not judged rightly or kept God's law, swift judgment threatens, while mercy is more readily extended to the lowly. The author urges devotion to Wisdom, portrayed as an unfading, accessible figure who eagerly meets those who seek her, especially those who embrace discipline, love, and obedience to her laws. Such obedience leads to incorruption and nearness to God, and the desire for Wisdom leads to a kingdom; therefore rulers should honor Wisdom to reign securely. The speaker promises to reveal Wisdom’s nature and origin faithfully, noting that a wise king upholds the people and that many wise persons benefit the world, and he exhorts the audience to receive instruction.",
  "externalContext": "The Wisdom of Solomon is a Hellenistic Jewish work, likely composed in Greek in Alexandria between the late first century BCE and early first century CE. It participates in the Jewish sapiential tradition while employing Greek philosophical and rhetorical styles, notably personifying Wisdom (Sophia) as a beneficent guide. The book is part of the Septuagint and is received as Scripture in Catholic and Orthodox canons, while many Protestant traditions classify it as deuterocanonical/apocryphal. The setting presumes a world where Jews lived under foreign rule and where questions of just governance and divine accountability were pressing.",
  "externalReferences": "This chapter’s warning to rulers and affirmation that God shows no partiality echoes Deuteronomy 10:17 and the judicial charge in 2 Chronicles 19:6–7. Its admonition to rulers parallels Psalm 82:1–8, where God judges unjust “gods” or rulers. The portrayal of Wisdom’s accessibility and her role in just governance aligns closely with Proverbs 8:15–17, 34–36, where Wisdom declares, “By me kings reign” and promises to be found by those who seek her diligently.",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The scope of “reign for evermore” (v.21) and “bringeth to a kingdom” (v.20) is ambiguous—whether it promises enduring earthly stability, eschatological rule, or both. The wording “mercy will soon pardon the meanest” (v.6) depends on translation nuances about the lowly. The phrase “she preventeth them that desire her” (v.13) likely means Wisdom anticipates seekers, but the degree of human initiative versus divine initiative is not fully specified. The criteria for being “worthy of her” (v.16) are implied (discipline, love, obedience) but not exhaustively defined.",

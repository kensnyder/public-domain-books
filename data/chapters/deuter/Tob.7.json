  "briefOverview": "Tobias and Raphael arrive at Raguel’s home in Ecbatana, where Tobias is formally given Sarah in marriage. The family extends hospitality and blessing despite the ominous history of Sarah’s prior husbands’ deaths.",
  "summary": "Upon reaching Ecbatana, Tobias and Raphael are welcomed by Raguel’s household; Raguel recognizes Tobias as Tobit’s son and weeps on hearing of Tobit’s blindness. They share a meal, and Tobias asks Raphael (“Azarias”) to raise the marriage matter. Raguel affirms Tobias should marry Sarah but discloses that seven previous husbands died on their wedding nights. Tobias insists on a formal agreement; Raguel gives Sarah to Tobias “after the law of Moses,” blesses them, and has a written covenant prepared and sealed. The feast begins, a bridal chamber is prepared, and Edna comforts her weeping daughter with words of hope and blessing.",
  "externalContext": "Ecbatana (modern Hamadan) was a principal city of Media and later the Achaemenid Persian Empire, a context consistent with Jewish diaspora life after the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles. Identifying as “sons of Naphtali” in Nineveh reflects northern Israelite deportations under Assyrian rule. Marriages within extended kin were common in antiquity and, in Israel’s tradition, could help keep inheritance within the clan. Written marriage contracts (a practice widespread in the Persian period and later) formalized obligations and dowry arrangements, aligning with the “instrument of covenants” mentioned here.",
  "externalReferences": "Raguel’s desire to marry Sarah within the family aligns with inheritance-preserving principles seen in Numbers 36:6–9. The family blessing over the marriage echoes the familial blessing of Rebekah in Genesis 24:60. The chapter’s explicit portrayal of marriage as a solemn, covenanted union coheres with the prophetic description of marriage as a covenant in Malachi 2:14. The motif of a woman associated with seven deceased husbands is reminiscent of the Sadducees’ hypothetical case in Mark 12:20–22, suggesting a later echo of a known tradition.",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The phrase “after the law of Moses” is not specific about which legal provisions are in view; it likely refers generally to lawful, kin-appropriate marriage rather than a particular statute. The exact nature of the “instrument of covenants” cannot be detailed from the text alone beyond being a formal marriage document. The chapter notes seven husbands’ deaths without stating the cause here, which is explained elsewhere in the book.",

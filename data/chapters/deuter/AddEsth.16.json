  "chapterOsisID": "AddEsth.16",
  "briefOverview": "A royal rescript from Artaxerxes annuls Haman’s plot, praises the Jews and their God, and authorizes Jewish self-defense and commemoration.",
  "summary": "Artaxerxes writes to all provinces warning that corrupt favorites can mislead kings and cause innocent bloodshed. He indicts Haman, described as a Macedonian outsider who abused royal favor, plotted against Mordecai and Esther, and sought to transfer Persian power. The king declares the Jews righteous and the children of the Most High God, credits God’s justice for Haman’s downfall, and notes Haman’s execution at Susa. He orders Haman’s letters voided, commands public posting of this new decree, and permits Jews to live under their own laws. He authorizes them to defend themselves on the thirteenth of Adar, stating that God has turned the threatened destruction into joy. The day is to be kept as a festival for salvation, and cities refusing compliance will face severe punishment.",
  "externalContext": "In the Greek (Septuagint) version of Esther, the Persian king is called Artaxerxes rather than Ahasuerus (commonly identified with Xerxes I in the Hebrew text), and the book contains several additions, including royal letters and prayers. These additions are received as Scripture in Catholic and Orthodox canons and are often placed as separate chapters or interwoven with the Hebrew narrative. The empire’s extent “from India to Ethiopia” and the reference to 127 satrapies reflect the Achaemenid administrative world. The portrayal of Haman as a “Macedonian” is likely a Hellenistic-era note, contrasting Persian legitimacy with Macedonian ambitions after Alexander’s conquests. Royal edicts disseminated by couriers to all provinces were a standard Persian administrative practice.",
  "externalReferences": "This edict mirrors the counter-decree empowering Jewish self-defense in Esther 8:8–13 and reverses the earlier genocidal order sent out in Esther 3:12–15. Haman’s execution at Susa aligns with Esther 7:9–10. The commendation of Mordecai as a royal benefactor recalls his earlier service in uncovering a plot against the king (Esther 2:21–23). The command to commemorate the deliverance anticipates the establishment of Purim in Esther 9:20–22.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The identification of the king as “Artaxerxes” versus the Hebrew “Ahasuerus” (Xerxes) reflects textual traditions; the label of Haman as “Macedonian” may be anachronistic. The statement that Haman was hanged “with all his household” differs from the Hebrew narrative’s sequence regarding Haman and his sons. The precise historical alignment of this rescript with the MT chronology is assumed but not explicit in this chapter.",

  "chapterOsisID": "Abr.2",
  "briefOverview": "Abraham recounts his divine call, covenant promises, and journey from Mesopotamia to Canaan, then toward Egypt because of famine. The Lord identifies himself, extends priesthood-centered promises, and instructs Abraham regarding Sarai’s safety in Egypt.",
  "summary": "A severe famine strikes Ur; Haran dies, and Abraham marries Sarai while his brother Nahor marries Milcah. God commands Abraham to leave his country, leading him, Lot, and their households from Ur to Haran, where Terah remains in idolatry. The Lord appears to Abraham, declares his name as Jehovah, describes his sovereign power, and promises to make Abraham a great nation, to extend priesthood and gospel blessings through his seed to all nations, and to bless those who bless him. Abraham departs Haran at age sixty-two with Sarai and Lot, traveling by Jershon into Canaan, where he builds altars at places including Moreh and near Bethel and Hai, and receives the land promise for his seed. Continued famine drives him to go down to Egypt; the Lord forewarns that Sarai’s beauty will place Abraham at risk and directs that she be identified as his sister to preserve his life.",
  "externalContext": "In ancient Near Eastern tradition, long-distance movements from southern Mesopotamia (Ur) to northern Mesopotamia (Haran) and then to Canaan followed established trade routes. Haran was a significant caravan and cultic center in Upper Mesopotamia, while the Canaanite hill country (Shechem/Moreh, Bethel, Ai) later became central in Israel’s ancestral narratives. Altars and sacrifices marked covenantal encounters and claims to sacred space. Egypt frequently served as a refuge in times of Levantine famine due to the Nile’s predictability. The name Jehovah reflects the English rendering of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) in older English Bibles, typically shown as LORD in small caps.",
  "externalReferences": "This chapter parallels Genesis 12:1–20, including the call to leave kindred, the promises to make Abraham a great nation, the building of altars at Shechem (Moreh) and near Bethel/Ai, and the descent to Egypt because of famine. It also echoes Genesis 11:31–32 regarding the family’s residence in Haran and Terah’s role. The emphasis on blessing all nations through Abraham aligns with Genesis 12:2–3 and is later interpreted in Galatians 3:8–9, 29 as encompassing those who receive the gospel by faith. Divine self-descriptions in this chapter resemble language such as “the earth is my footstool” (Isaiah 66:1) and “declaring the end from the beginning” (Isaiah 46:10).",

  "uncertainAreas": "The identification and location of “Jershon” on the route from Haran to Canaan are unclear. The phrase “souls that we had won in Haran” could mean converts, dependents, or servants and is not specified. Abraham’s age at departure from Haran (sixty-two) differs from Genesis’ chronology, creating a harmonization question. Here the instruction to present Sarai as Abraham’s sister is attributed to the Lord, differing from Genesis 12 where it appears as Abraham’s initiative; the relationship between these accounts is not resolved in the text.",

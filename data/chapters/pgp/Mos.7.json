  "chapterOsisID": "Mos.7",
  "briefOverview": "Enoch recounts visions of the rise of Zion, divine judgments on widespread wickedness, and God’s redemptive plan culminating in Christ’s atonement and a millennial rest.",
  "summary": "Enoch, commissioned to preach repentance and baptize, exercises miraculous power as the Lord gathers a righteous people who become “Zion,” a unified, just society without poor, eventually taken up into heaven. He prophesies conflicts among early peoples, curses on lands, and ongoing wars, while God dwells with the righteous. Enoch then beholds the spread of Satan’s influence over the earth, the weeping of God over human violence and hatred, and the decree of a coming flood, yet also the advocacy and future suffering of the Chosen One for repentant humanity. He sees Noah and the ark preserved, mourns for the destroyed, and is shown the meridian of time when the Son of Man will be lifted up, the earth and heavens will mourn, and spirits in prison will be ministered to. Seeking when the earth will rest, Enoch is promised a latter-day period when righteousness and truth will flood the earth, gather the elect to a prepared Holy City (New Jerusalem), and usher in a thousand-year reign of peace. The chapter closes by noting Zion’s translation and the enduring saying, “Zion is fled.”",
  "externalContext": "In Latter-day Saint scripture, the Book of Moses is part of the Pearl of Great Price and derives from Joseph Smith’s early 19th‑century revision and expansion of Genesis, often called the Joseph Smith Translation. Traditions about Enoch beyond the Bible appear in Second Temple Jewish literature (e.g., 1 Enoch), depicting Enoch as a visionary who sees cosmic history and divine judgment. Apocalyptic expectations of a final judgment, a renewed earth, and a holy city (New Jerusalem) are common in Jewish and Christian texts. Latter-day Saints often read phrases like “truth will I send forth out of the earth” in light of their Restoration narrative and the coming forth of additional scripture.",
  "externalReferences": "The translation of Enoch and the theme that he “walked with God” resonate with Genesis 5:24 and Hebrews 11:5; Jude 1:14–15 also preserves a tradition of Enoch’s prophecy. The flood, Noah, and the ark align with Genesis 6–9. The preaching to spirits in prison echoes 1 Peter 3:18–20 and 4:6. The millennial reign and New Jerusalem reflect Revelation 20:1–6 and 21:1–4, while the earth’s groaning parallels Romans 8:19–22.",

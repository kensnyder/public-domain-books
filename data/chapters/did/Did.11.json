  "briefOverview": "Practical rules for receiving itinerant apostles, prophets, and teachers, with tests to discern true from false ministers.",
  "summary": "Communities should receive any teacher who upholds the previously taught instruction and promotes righteousness and knowledge of the Lord, but reject anyone teaching destructive doctrine. Apostles are to be welcomed as the Lord, yet not remain beyond one or two days, and must not request money; asking for money marks a false prophet. Prophets speaking “in the Spirit” are not to be rashly judged, yet they must be evaluated by their conduct: true prophets keep the Lord’s ways, practice what they teach, and do not exploit hospitality. A prophet who orders a meal “in the Spirit” should not eat it himself, and anyone who asks for gifts for personal gain is to be refused, whereas appeals for the needy should be honored. Some proven prophets may perform distinctive acts as part of their calling without prescribing them for others, and such should be left to God’s judgment, as with the ancient prophets.",
  "externalContext": "The Didache is an early Christian church manual, commonly dated to the late first or early second century, addressing ethics, worship, and community order. Early Christian communities often hosted itinerant missionaries, prophets, and teachers who traveled between house-churches in a culture where hospitality was a social norm. The broader term “apostles” here likely includes traveling envoys beyond the Twelve, while “prophets” denotes charismatic speakers believed to deliver Spirit-inspired messages. Regulations about limited stays and refusal of payment reflect concerns about itinerant charlatans and the economic vulnerability of small congregations. The instruction to act according to the “decree of the Gospel” likely echoes Jesus’ sending instructions for mission, which emphasized simplicity and dependence on hospitality.",
  "externalReferences": "The limits on money and travel provisions reflect Jesus’ mission instructions: taking no money bag and relying on hospitality (Matthew 10:5–15; Luke 10:4–8), and the promise that receiving messengers is receiving Christ (Matthew 10:40–42). The call to discern prophets by their “ways” aligns with testing by fruits (Matthew 7:15–20) and, more broadly, testing the spirits (1 John 4:1). The warning about an unforgivable sin when judging one who speaks “in the Spirit” may allude to the Gospel warning about blasphemy against the Holy Spirit (Matthew 12:31–32; Mark 3:29; Luke 12:10).",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "How can a community welcome spiritual leaders warmly while setting healthy boundaries that prevent exploitation?",
    "What concrete behaviors (“ways”) should we look for to discern whether a teacher lives the truth they proclaim?",
    "How should churches handle requests for money from ministers or ministries, and distinguish personal gain from aid for the needy?",
    "When might it be appropriate not to judge distinctive prophetic actions, and how can we keep such allowance from excusing hypocrisy?",
    "What policies could our community adopt (e.g., limits on length of stay or financial requests) that reflect both charity and accountability?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The precise meaning of “this sin shall not be forgiven” in relation to testing prophets is ambiguous; it likely echoes the Gospels’ warning about blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, but its application here is debated. The phrase about a prophet ordering a meal “in the Spirit” and not eating it is unclear—possibly a safeguard against using spiritual claims to secure food. The scope of “apostles” (beyond the Twelve) and the exact content of the “decree of the Gospel” are not specified. The nature of prophetic acts done as part of the “mystery of the Church” remains undefined.",

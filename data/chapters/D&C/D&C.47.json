  "briefOverview": "The revelation appoints John to keep the church’s history and records, assist Joseph in transcribing revelations, and authorizes him to speak in meetings with the Spirit’s help.",
  "summary": "The Lord declares it is expedient that his servant John write and keep a regular history and assist Joseph in transcribing revelations until he is assigned further duties. John may lift up his voice in meetings when expedient. He is appointed to continually keep the church record and history, as Oliver Cowdery has been assigned to another office. The Lord promises that, if faithful, John will be enabled by the Comforter to write these things.",
  "externalContext": "In early 1831, the Latter-day Saint movement was expanding in Ohio, generating a need for formal record-keeping and organization. John Whitmer, one of the Eight Witnesses of the Book of Mormon, became the first official Church Historian and Recorder and began compiling early church history and minutes. Oliver Cowdery had previously served as Joseph Smith’s principal scribe and church recorder, but he was taking on other responsibilities at this time. Meticulous minutes and histories were common among American religious movements, and early Latter-day Saints placed strong emphasis on preserving revelations and institutional memory.",
  "externalReferences": "This directive echoes the earlier command at the church’s organization that “there shall be a record kept among you” (Doctrine and Covenants 21:1). Later, John Whitmer is specifically instructed to accompany Oliver Cowdery and continue keeping the church history (Doctrine and Covenants 69:1–8). The promise that the “Comforter” will enable him to write parallels Jesus’s teaching that the Comforter would teach and bring all things to remembrance (John 14:26).",

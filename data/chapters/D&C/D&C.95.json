  "briefOverview": "A divine rebuke urges the Saints to build the Lord’s house so that chosen servants may be endowed with power, with specific instructions for its design and purposes.",
  "summary": "The Lord, expressing love that chastens, rebukes the Saints for neglecting the command to build His house and calls their omission a grievous sin. He explains the temple is needed to prepare His apostles to prune the vineyard, to accomplish His “strange act,” and to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh. Though many are ordained, few are chosen because some walk in darkness despite the noonday light, and contention in the School of the Prophets has been grievous. A solemn assembly and fasting are commanded so their petitions come before the Lord of Sabaoth. The Lord reiterates the command to build the house, promising enabling power for obedience and warning of spiritual darkness for disobedience. He then gives design directives: it must not follow the world’s manner, three appointed will receive the pattern, its inner court is to be 55 by 65 feet, with the lower part dedicated for sacraments, preaching, fasting, prayer, and holy desires, and the higher part dedicated as the school of the apostles.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is historically situated in Kirtland, Ohio (1833), shortly after earlier instructions to organize the School of the Prophets and to build a sacred house. The fledgling Latter-day Saint community faced limited resources and competing demands, contributing to the delay. In early Latter-day Saint usage, a “solemn assembly” was a formal, covenantal gathering patterned partly on biblical precedent and later used for temple dedications. The Kirtland Temple, whose basic dimensions align with the instructions here, was constructed between 1833 and 1836, becoming the site of significant religious gatherings and instruction.",
  "externalReferences": "The mandate to build the house echoes and clarifies the earlier instruction in Doctrine and Covenants 88:119 to establish “a house of prayer… of God.” The promise to “endow… with power from on high” and the command to “tarry” parallel Luke 24:49 and Acts 1:4, where the apostles await the promised endowment of the Spirit at Jerusalem. “Many are called, but few are chosen” recalls Matthew 22:14 and is similarly reemphasized in Doctrine and Covenants 121:34. The phrases “my strange act” and the outpouring of the Spirit resonate with Isaiah 28:21 and Joel 2:28, respectively, suggesting eschatological preparation and widespread spiritual gifts.",

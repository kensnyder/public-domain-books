  "briefOverview": "An interpretation of Jesus’s parable of the wheat and tares is applied to apostasy and the last-days harvest, followed by assurances about priesthood lineage and mission.",
  "summary": "The Lord interprets the parable of the wheat and tares: the world is the field and the apostles sowed the seed; after their deaths, the adversary sowed tares through persecuting, apostate powers symbolized as Babylon, driving the church into the wilderness. In the last days, as the tender blade of the work springs up, angels stand ready to reap but are restrained so the wheat is not harmed, allowing both wheat and tares to mature until harvest, when the wheat will be gathered and the tares bound to be burned. The Lord then addresses those with whom the priesthood has continued through the lineage of their fathers, calling them lawful heirs who have been hid with Christ in God. Their life and priesthood are to remain through their lineage until the promised restoration of all things. They are blessed if they continue in God’s goodness, serving as a light to the Gentiles and a savior to Israel.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation comes from the early period of the Latter-day Saint movement, when Joseph Smith produced interpretations of biblical passages in light of a broader restorationist project. Early Latter-day Saint teaching emphasized a Great Apostasy after the time of the New Testament apostles and a subsequent restoration of priesthood authority. The parable of the wheat and tares (from the New Testament) was commonly read eschatologically in Christian traditions, and this text situates that harvest in the “last days.” Language about being a “light to the Gentiles” and about priesthood lineage reflects the movement’s self-understanding in relation to Israel’s covenant promises.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter explicitly interprets Jesus’s parable of the wheat and tares (Matthew 13:24–30), identifying the apostles as sowers, the world as the field, and a delayed harvest until maturity. Its imagery of Babylon, the persecuting “whore” making nations drink of her cup, echoes Revelation 14:8; 17:1–6; and 18:3. The readiness of angels to reap and the final burning of the field resonate with Revelation 14:14–20 and Matthew 13:39–43. Phrases such as “hid with Christ in God” allude to Colossians 3:3, while “the restoration of all things” recalls Acts 3:21; being “a light to the Gentiles” draws from Isaiah 42:6 and 49:6, and “a savior unto my people Israel” reflects language associated with Obadiah 1:21 and Latter-day Saint usage.",

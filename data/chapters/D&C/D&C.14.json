  "briefOverview": "A revelation calls David Whitmer to assist in the Lord’s work, emphasizing urgent missionary labor, obedience, and the promise of the Holy Ghost.",
  "summary": "The Lord declares a “great and marvelous work” is imminent and urges attention to His powerful word. Using harvest imagery, He calls all who are willing to “thrust in [their] sickle” and promises salvation to diligent laborers. He assures seekers that if they ask and knock, they will receive, and commands them to establish Zion and keep all His commandments, with the promise of eternal life for those who endure to the end. He further promises that asking the Father in Christ’s name with faith will result in receiving the Holy Ghost to empower witness and the preaching of repentance. Jesus Christ identifies Himself as the Creator and unfailing Light, stating His intent to bring the fulness of His gospel from the Gentiles to the house of Israel. Addressing David by name, He calls him to assist and promises both spiritual and temporal blessings and a great reward if he is faithful.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is addressed to David Whitmer in June 1829 in Fayette, New York, during the final phase of the Book of Mormon translation at the Whitmer home. The Church of Christ (later known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) had not yet been formally organized; early revelations frequently called individuals to assist in bringing forth the Book of Mormon and in preparing for public preaching. David Whitmer soon became one of the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon. Early Latter-day Saint discourse often emphasized building “Zion” (an ideal covenant community) and the gathering of Israel, themes that shaped subsequent missionary and organizational efforts.",
  "externalReferences": "The imagery of the harvest echoes Jesus’ words about fields “white already to harvest” (John 4:35) and parallels earlier Latter-day Saint revelations on missionary labor (Doctrine and Covenants 4:4). The description of God’s word as “sharper than a two-edged sword” closely reflects Hebrews 4:12. The assurance “ask…seek…knock” aligns with Matthew 7:7, and the promise of the Holy Ghost giving “utterance” evokes Pentecost narratives (Acts 2:4). The phrase “a marvelous work” recalls Isaiah 29:14 and is elaborated in the Book of Mormon (2 Nephi 27), while the movement of the gospel “from the Gentiles unto the house of Israel” resonates with the New Testament’s Gentile mission and Israel’s eventual inclusion (Romans 11:11–25) and Book of Mormon teachings on the gathering (3 Nephi 20–21).",

  "uncertainAreas": "“From the Gentiles unto the house of Israel” could imply several mechanisms (missionary outreach, covenant adoption, or eschatological fulfillment); the text does not specify how this transfer unfolds. The scope and timetable of “establish my Zion” are not defined. The phrase “giveth utterance” may indicate gifts of speech or broader spiritual empowerment, but the precise manifestation is not detailed. The nature of promised “temporal” blessings is unspecified.",

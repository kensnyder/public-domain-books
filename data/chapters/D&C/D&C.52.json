  "briefOverview": "Revelation directing elders to travel in pairs toward Missouri, outlining missionary conduct and a pattern for discerning true spiritual influence.",
  "summary": "The Lord instructs the elders on what to do until the next conference, to be held in Missouri, described as the land to be consecrated for the covenant people. Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon are to travel to Missouri, with many named elders assigned in pairs to preach along the way, baptize, confirm by laying on of hands, and speak only what prophets and apostles have written and what the Comforter teaches. The Lord provides a discernment pattern: those who are contrite, meek, edifying, obedient to ordinances, and who bring forth fruits of praise and wisdom are of God; those who are overcome and unfruitful are not. Specific cautions are given (e.g., to Lyman Wight), priesthood ordinations are directed, and stewardship changes are made because of transgression. Elders are to labor with their hands, avoid idolatry and wickedness, care for the poor and afflicted, and carry recommends. The Lord promises that the faithful will rejoice in Missouri and be lifted up at the last day, though the land is presently held by enemies, and that the city will be hastened in its time.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is historically dated to early June 1831 in Kirtland, Ohio, during a church conference that organized significant missionary efforts and leadership roles. Missouri, then part of the American frontier, lay at the edge of U.S. westward expansion and attracted various settlers; Latter-day Saints would soon identify Jackson County as the center place of Zion (formally declared in a subsequent revelation). Travel routes mentioned (e.g., via Detroit) reflect common canal and overland corridors used by early missionaries. Letters of “recommend” functioned as attestations of standing and fellowship as members moved among branches. These assignments occurred amid a broader effort to consolidate church organization and expand missionary work across the Midwest and eastern United States.",
  "externalReferences": "The instruction to travel and preach in pairs echoes Jesus sending disciples “two by two” (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1). The warning that “Satan desireth to sift” mirrors Jesus’ words to Peter (Luke 22:31), while the promise that the faithful will be made “ruler over many things” recalls the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:21). The admonition to lay hands following baptism aligns with apostolic practice of conferral of the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:14–17; Hebrews 6:2). The idea of the Lord “cutting [His] work short in righteousness” parallels Romans 9:28, and the discernment of spirits by fruits and edification is consonant with Moroni 7:16–17 in the Book of Mormon; forthcoming identification of Missouri’s “center place” appears in Doctrine and Covenants 57.",

    "What does it look like today not to “build upon another’s foundation” in collaborative ministry contexts?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The exact scope of the “pattern in all things” (vv. 14–19) and how comprehensively it applies to every spiritual manifestation can be read more narrowly or broadly. The directive that one should not build on another’s foundation (v. 33) may mean distinct travel routes or a wider principle about avoiding overlap; the text favors routes but leaves the broader application open. The phrase “land of your inheritance” and “hasten the city” point to Zion in Missouri, but the specifics are given more fully in a later revelation (D&C 57). The statement that Missouri is “now the land of your enemies” is not explained here, leaving the nature and extent of that opposition unspecified.",

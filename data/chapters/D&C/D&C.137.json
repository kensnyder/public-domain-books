  "briefOverview": "Joseph Smith reports a vision of the celestial kingdom and receives teaching on the fate of those who die without knowing the gospel and of children who die young.",
  "summary": "Joseph Smith sees the celestial kingdom, including its fiery gate, golden streets, and the throne of the Father and the Son. He beholds Adam, Abraham, his parents, and his deceased brother Alvin. Wondering how Alvin could be there despite dying before baptism and before the latter-day gathering, he receives the Lord’s explanation that all who die without knowledge of the gospel, and who would have accepted it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom. The Lord affirms that judgment is according to both works and the desires of the heart. He also declares that all children who die before reaching the years of accountability are saved in the celestial kingdom.",
  "externalContext": "This vision is historically connected to early 1836 in Kirtland, Ohio, during a period of temple-focused worship and visions among early Latter-day Saints. It predates the formal introduction of vicarious temple ordinances for the dead (publicly taught in 1840) and anticipates later teachings about redemption of the dead. The Kirtland Temple era was marked by reports of heavenly manifestations and the development of doctrine about degrees of glory and priesthood keys.",
  "externalReferences": "This vision expands themes first outlined in D&C 76:50–70 regarding the celestial kingdom, now emphasizing the salvation of those who die without gospel knowledge. The assurance that the dead can yet benefit from Christ’s gospel resonates with 1 Peter 3:19 and 4:6 about the gospel being preached to the spirits in prison, and with 1 Corinthians 15:29’s mention of baptism for the dead. The declaration that children who die are saved coheres with Book of Mormon teachings in Moroni 8:8–12 that little children are alive in Christ and need no baptism.",

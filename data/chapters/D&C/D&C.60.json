  "briefOverview": "The Lord directs certain elders to return from Zion with diligence, correcting some for fearfully withholding their witness and giving detailed travel and preaching instructions.",
  "summary": "The Lord is pleased that the elders have gathered but rebukes some for hiding their talents and fearing man, warning that blessings may be taken if they are not faithful. He affirms His sovereign power and then gives logistical directions: secure a craft to go to St. Louis; Joseph Smith Jr., Sidney Rigdon, and Oliver Cowdery are to continue to Cincinnati, preaching boldly and prayerfully. The remaining elders are to travel two by two, preaching among the wicked without haste, for the strengthening of the churches. Bishop Edward Partridge is to provide needed funds for returning elders, with repayment expected only if possible. Those who come to Zion are commanded not to idle but to proclaim the gospel and then return, preaching steadily and peaceably; if rejected, they are to shake off the dust in secret and wash their feet as a testimony. Final specifics concerning Rigdon and Cowdery will be made known through Joseph Smith Jr.",
  "externalContext": "In 1831, early Latter-day Saint leaders were traveling between Ohio and Missouri as Jackson County, Missouri, had been identified as the land of Zion (see Doctrine and Covenants 57). St. Louis and Cincinnati were major river and trade hubs on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, making boat travel a practical means for missionary movement and return. Edward Partridge, called as the first bishop (Doctrine and Covenants 41), oversaw temporal affairs and disbursement of funds to support elders’ travel and needs. Sending missionaries two by two reflects common early Christian and early Latter-day Saint practice for safety, companionship, and effective ministry.",
  "externalReferences": "The rebuke for hiding talents echoes Jesus’s Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14–30) and the Parable of the Minas (Luke 19:11–27), warning against fear-based inaction. Instructions to shake off the dust against rejecting audiences reflect Christ’s directive to His disciples (Matthew 10:14; Luke 9:5; see also Acts 13:51), though here it specifies doing so privately to avoid provocation. The call to pray and preach “without wrath or doubting” and to lift up “holy hands” parallels 1 Timothy 2:8. The phrase about making up God’s “jewels” recalls Malachi 3:17, emphasizing divine ownership and final vindication; sending missionaries “two by two” echoes Luke 10:1.",

  "uncertainAreas": "“Congregations of the wicked” is not defined and could mean resistant or nonbelieving audiences generally. The instruction to wash feet as a testimony may be ritual or symbolic; the text does not detail the form. “Craft made, or bought” likely means a watercraft but is not explicitly specified. The identity and role of “the agent” for returning funds is not clarified here. The timing and content of further directions about Rigdon and Cowdery (“the residue hereafter”) are not given in this section.",

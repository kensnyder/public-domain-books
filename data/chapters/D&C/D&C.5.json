  "briefOverview": "Revelatory counsel to Joseph Smith concerning Martin Harris’s request for a witness and the forthcoming testimonies that will accompany the translation of the plates.",
  "summary": "The Lord instructs Joseph Smith to tell Martin Harris that Joseph has received the plates and the gift to translate, and that he must show them only to those whom God appoints. God warns of the generation’s unbelief, stating that His word will come through Joseph and that three specific witnesses will be granted power to view the sacred objects and testify. Believers are promised spiritual manifestations and to be born of God, even of water and the Spirit, while the unrepentant face condemnation and a desolating scourge, likened to earlier divine warnings about Jerusalem’s destruction. Joseph is commanded to repent, be firm, and resist human pressure, with a promise of eternal life if faithful, even unto death. Martin is told he must humble himself in sincere faith and prayer to receive a view; if he does, he must testify only that he has seen by God’s power, but if he denies, he breaks covenant and is condemned. If Martin does not humble himself, Joseph is to cease translating for a season, lest he lose his gift; God foresees threats against Joseph and provides commands to preserve him and ensure the work proceeds in God’s timing.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to early 1829 during the period when Joseph Smith was translating the Book of Mormon and before the formal organization of the Church of Christ in 1830. Martin Harris, an early supporter, had previously lost the 116 manuscript pages in 1828, leading to earlier rebukes and a temporary loss of Joseph’s translating privilege. Local skepticism and social pressure were intense, prompting Harris’s desire for a concrete witness to persuade others and to reassure himself. The statement that Joseph would be ordained reflects the emerging structure of authority that would soon be formalized in the early Latter-day Saint movement.",
  "externalReferences": "The promise of “three witnesses” aligns with Book of Mormon prophecies that multiple witnesses would testify of the record (2 Nephi 27:12–13; Ether 5:2–4) and reflects the biblical principle that truth is established by two or three witnesses (Deuteronomy 19:15; 2 Corinthians 13:1). The language about being “born of water and of the Spirit” echoes Jesus’ teaching to Nicodemus (John 3:5). The warning that God’s word about destruction will be verified “as [He] told the people of the destruction of Jerusalem” recalls Jesus’ predictions of Jerusalem’s fall (Luke 21:20–24; Matthew 24:2). The imagery of the church emerging “out of the wilderness…clear as the moon, fair as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners” resonates with Song of Solomon 6:10 and the wilderness motif in Revelation 12:6.",

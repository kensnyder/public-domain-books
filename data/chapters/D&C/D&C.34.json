  "briefOverview": "A revelation to Orson, identifying Jesus as Redeemer and commissioning him to preach repentance in anticipation of the Second Coming.",
  "summary": "Jesus Christ addresses Orson, identifying himself as the light and life of the world and affirming God’s love that grants believers power to become sons of God. Orson is blessed for believing and is called to preach the gospel loudly and boldly to a perverse generation, preparing for the Lord’s return. The Lord declares that his coming is soon, with nations trembling and cosmic signs—darkened sun, blood-red moon, falling and dimmed stars—preceding the day. Orson is commanded to prophesy by the power of the Holy Ghost and promised the Lord’s presence if he remains faithful. The message concludes with a reaffirmation that Christ comes quickly as Lord and Redeemer.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is traditionally dated to November 1830 in the early months of the Latter-day Saint movement, a period marked by energetic missionary efforts and apocalyptic expectation in the broader American religious landscape. Orson is understood to be Orson Pratt, a young convert who soon became a prominent preacher and later an apostle in the movement. Early nineteenth-century Protestant discourse often drew on biblical apocalyptic imagery, which aligns with the revelation’s emphasis on imminent divine intervention and cosmic signs.",
  "externalReferences": "The self-identification of Christ as the light that shines in darkness echoes John 1:4–5, and the declaration of God’s love parallels John 3:16; the promise that believers become the “sons of God” resonates with John 1:12. The charge to “lift up your voice” like a trumpet recalls Isaiah 58:1, and the description of a “crooked and perverse generation” parallels Philippians 2:15. The cosmic signs—darkened sun, moon turned to blood, and falling stars—draw on Joel 2:31 (cited in Acts 2:20) and the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24:29–30; cf. Mark 13:24–26; Luke 21:25–27). The assurance “I come quickly” aligns with Revelation 22:20 and the image of coming in clouds with power and glory reflects Matthew 24:30 and Revelation 1:7.",

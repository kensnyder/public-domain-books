  "briefOverview": "Jesus Christ commissions designated witnesses to view sacred artifacts by faith and to testify, assuring divine protection and the truth of the translation.",
  "summary": "The Lord promises that if the recipients rely fully on his word, they will behold the plates and associated sacred objects—the breastplate, the sword of Laban, the Urim and Thummim given to the brother of Jared, and the miraculous directors given to Lehi. Their viewing depends on faith like that of ancient prophets, and after seeing, they are commanded to testify by God’s power so that Joseph Smith will not be destroyed and God’s purposes may advance. They are to affirm that they have seen the artifacts just as Joseph has, whose translation of the commanded portion is declared true. The Lord further assures them that they have received the same power, faith, and gift, and promises that if they keep these commandments the gates of hell will not prevail against them and they will be lifted up at the last day, confirming his words as their Lord and God.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is historically associated with June 1829 in Fayette, New York, directed to Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, later known as the Three Witnesses of the Book of Mormon. Shortly after, they reported seeing the plates and other artifacts by an angelic manifestation and signed the “Testimony of Three Witnesses,” published with the 1830 Book of Mormon. In early Latter-day Saint usage, the term “Urim and Thummim” referred to the interpreters described in the Book of Mormon as instruments prepared by the Lord for translation.",
  "externalReferences": "The promise of designated witnesses fulfills an earlier revelation about three witnesses (Doctrine and Covenants 5:11–15). The listed artifacts tie directly to Book of Mormon narratives: the sword of Laban (1 Nephi 4:9–18), the Liahona or “miraculous directors” (1 Nephi 16:10–16; Alma 37:38), and the interpreters given to the brother of Jared (Ether 3:6–20, 22–28; cf. Mosiah 8:13–19; 28:13–16). The phrase “the gates of hell shall not prevail” echoes language used by Jesus concerning the church’s endurance (Matthew 16:18).",

  "uncertainAreas": "The addressees are unnamed in the text (historically identified as the Three Witnesses). The scope of “the same power, and the same faith, and the same gift like unto him” could refer broadly to witnessing rather than specifically to translating. The phrase about Joseph Smith not being “destroyed” is not defined (physical harm, legal peril, or spiritual opposition).",

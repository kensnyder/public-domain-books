  "chapterOsisID": "D&C.67",
  "briefOverview": "The Lord addresses assembled elders, rebuking their fear and affirming the authenticity of the revelations to be published. He challenges doubters to match the least of these revelations and outlines the humility and spiritual preparation required to behold His presence.",
  "summary": "The Lord tells the elders He knows their hearts and that their fear prevented them from receiving the promised blessing. He bears witness of the revelations before them and notes their focus on Joseph Smith’s imperfect language. The elders are challenged to select the wisest among them to produce a revelation like the least in the Book of Commandments; failure to do so obligates them to testify of the revelations’ truth. He affirms that righteousness comes from above and promises that if they strip themselves of jealousy and fear and humble themselves, the veil will be rent so they may know Him spiritually. Because the natural man cannot abide God's presence, they must be patient and await the Lord’s due time to fully experience what was conferred through Joseph Smith.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was given in November 1831 during a conference of elders in Hiram, Ohio, where leaders discussed publishing the revelations as the Book of Commandments. Some participants expressed concern about the revelations’ literary style and Joseph Smith’s phrasing. Historical accounts report that William E. McLellin was selected to attempt a comparable revelation and failed, reinforcing the claim that the texts were divinely given. The Book of Commandments was later printed in 1833, and an expanded collection appeared as the Doctrine and Covenants in 1835.",
  "externalReferences": "The phrase “Father of lights” reflects James 1:17, linking the source of righteousness to God. “No man has seen God at any time” recalls John 1:18 and 1 John 4:12, while this text adds the qualification that one must be quickened by the Spirit to endure His presence. The contrast between natural/carnal understanding and spiritual discernment parallels 1 Corinthians 2:14 and, in Latter-day Saint scripture, Mosiah 3:19. References to the “ministering of angels” resonate with Hebrews 1:14’s depiction of angels as ministering spirits.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The exact meaning of “that which was conferred upon you by the hands of my servant Joseph Smith” is not specified (e.g., specific priesthood authority, spiritual endowment, or keys). The scope of “not able to abide the presence of God now, neither the ministering of angels” may be situational for these elders or a broader principle; the text does not fully clarify.",

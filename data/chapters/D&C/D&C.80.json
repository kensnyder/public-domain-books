  "briefOverview": "A revelation commissioning Stephen Burnett to preach the gospel, naming Eden Smith as a companion and emphasizing freedom in where to labor. It stresses bearing witness of known truth as the will of Jesus Christ.",
  "summary": "The Lord instructs Stephen Burnett to go into the world and preach the gospel to everyone who can hear him, granting Eden Smith as a companion if desired. He is told to go in any direction—north, south, east, or west—assured that he cannot go amiss. He is to declare what he has heard, believes, and knows to be true. The charge is affirmed as the will of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer.",
  "externalContext": "In the early 1830s, the Latter-day Saint movement frequently sent lay missionaries to travel widely, often with minimal resources and simple instructions. Assigning companions reflected both biblical precedent and practical safety and support during travel on the American frontier. Missions could be open-ended, allowing flexibility to follow opportunities and local receptivity rather than fixed itineraries. Such directions were part of a broader pattern of rapid evangelistic expansion in the movement’s formative years.",
  "externalReferences": "The command to “preach the gospel to every creature” echoes Jesus’ commission in Mark 16:15. Pairing a missionary with a companion reflects the biblical pattern of being sent “two and two,” as in Luke 10:1, and is consistent with earlier Latter-day Saint instruction in Doctrine and Covenants 42:6. The openness about direction (“north…south…east…west”) aligns with prior counsel that the gospel must go “into all the world…unto every creature” (Doctrine and Covenants 58:64).",

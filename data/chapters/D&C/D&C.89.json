  "briefOverview": "A health and dietary revelation outlining substances to avoid, foods to use with prudence, and promised blessings for obedience.",
  "summary": "Addressed as a “word of wisdom” rather than a binding command, the revelation warns of harmful designs in the last days and counsels against wine and strong drink except for sacramental use, specifies that sacramental wine should be pure and home-made, assigns strong drinks to external washing, and forbids tobacco for ingestion while allowing medicinal use for animals. It declares that “hot drinks” are not for the body. It affirms that wholesome herbs, fruits in their seasons, and grains are ordained for human use with prudence and thanksgiving, while meat should be used sparingly and, pleasing to the Lord, primarily in times of winter, cold, or famine. Grains are called the staff of life and are appointed for people and animals, with specific pairings noted; barley and other grains are mentioned for “mild drinks.” Those who obey receive promises of health, knowledge, endurance, and protection, likened to the destroying angel passing by Israel.",
  "externalContext": "Revealed in 1833 in Kirtland, Ohio, this section came amid widespread American temperance movements that criticized alcohol and tobacco use. Reports suggest tobacco use in the School of the Prophets and concerns about adulterated or hostilely sourced wine informed practical elements of the counsel. Although presented here as “not by commandment or constraint,” it later became a standard of Latter-day Saint practice, especially in the early 20th century. Early Latter-day Saint leaders contemporaneous with the text interpreted “hot drinks” to mean tea and coffee.",
  "externalReferences": "The promise that the “destroying angel shall pass by” echoes the Passover protection in Exodus 12:23. The line “run and not be weary, and … walk and not faint” closely parallels Isaiah 40:31. Counsel regarding sacramental wine aligns with earlier instruction to avoid purchasing from enemies and to use one’s own make (Doctrine and Covenants 27:2–4). Biblical cautions against intoxicants provide thematic parallels, such as Proverbs 20:1 and Proverbs 23:29–35, and the health outcome linked to dietary restraint recalls Daniel 1:8–15.",

    "How might I practice moderation in meat consumption, especially outside times of scarcity or cold, as the text commends?",

    "How do I discern between necessary medicinal uses and recreational or habitual uses of substances the text restricts?",
    "In what ways can I align my food choices with seasonality and gratitude, as the chapter emphasizes?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text does not define “hot drinks,” leaving its precise meaning to interpretation outside the chapter. The scope of “mild drinks” made from barley is ambiguous. Verses 12–15 on meat and the phrase “only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine” invite questions about normative versus exceptional use and whether “these” in v.15 refers to animals generally. The instruction about sacramental wine (vv.5–6) stands in some tension with D&C 27:2–4; harmonization relies on external interpretation.",

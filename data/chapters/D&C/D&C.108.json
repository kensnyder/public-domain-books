  "briefOverview": "A personal revelation to Lyman assuring forgiveness, urging renewed diligence and patience, and promising ordination and authority to preach. It concludes with a charge to strengthen fellow believers and a promise of the Lord’s abiding help.",
  "summary": "The Lord tells Lyman his sins are forgiven because he obeyed by seeking counsel, and bids him find rest regarding his standing and resist the Lord’s voice no longer. He is instructed to be more careful in keeping his vows and is promised great blessings. Lyman is to wait patiently for a forthcoming solemn assembly, where he will be remembered among the first elders and receive rights by ordination. If faithful, he will have authority to preach the gospel wherever the Lord sends him. He is charged to strengthen his brethren in speech, prayer, exhortation, and actions. The revelation ends with the Lord’s promise to be with him to bless and deliver him forever.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is dated to December 26, 1835, in Kirtland, Ohio, during a period of rapid organization and temple-focused preparation among early Latter-day Saints. The term “solemn assembly” in early Latter-day Saint practice refers to a sacred, formal gathering—often connected to temple worship and priesthood instruction—anticipated in connection with the completion and dedication of the Kirtland Temple in early 1836. Lyman Sherman, the addressee, was an early church member who sought personal counsel and assurance of standing during this period of heightened spiritual preparation.",
  "externalReferences": "The call to await a “solemn assembly” echoes earlier instructions to build a house of the Lord and to convene sacred assemblies for instruction and endowment (Doctrine and Covenants 88:117–120; 95:7–8). The promise of authority to preach aligns with other revelations commissioning elders to proclaim the gospel by divine appointment (Doctrine and Covenants 68:8). The charge to “strengthen your brethren” resonates with Jesus’ counsel to Peter to strengthen his brethren after being converted (Luke 22:32).",

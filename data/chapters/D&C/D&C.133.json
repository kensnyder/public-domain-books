  "briefOverview": "A prophetic call to leave spiritual Babylon, gather to Zion and Jerusalem, and prepare for the Lord’s imminent return and universal reign.",
  "summary": "The Lord commands His people to sanctify themselves, leave Babylon, and gather to Zion, sending missionaries first to the Gentiles and then to the Jews to enlarge Zion’s borders and prepare for the Bridegroom. He warns to watch and be ready, describing His coming with apocalyptic imagery: standing on the Mount of Olives and Mount Zion, His voice shaking the earth, lands reuniting, and the Lamb appearing with 144,000. The scattered of Israel, including those in the north countries, will be led by divine power, bringing treasures and receiving rich blessings, with special promises to Ephraim and sanctification to Judah. An angel with the everlasting gospel is sent so the message reaches every nation, calling all to fear God and give Him glory. The Lord is portrayed as the mighty Redeemer whose garments are red from treading the winepress, delivering His people and resurrecting the saints who sing the song of the Lamb in the New Jerusalem. The gospel’s purpose is to prepare the weak to confound the wise, offering eternal life to the repentant and warning of judgment upon those who reject God’s voice and His servants.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation, known historically as the “Appendix,” was received in November 1831 among early Latter-day Saints as an eschatological counterpart to the preface (Doctrine and Covenants 1). The community was emphasizing missionary expansion and the gathering to “Zion,” then associated with western Missouri, amid rising expectations of the Second Coming. In this period, “Gentiles” typically referred to non–covenant peoples (often Euro-American converts), while “Jews” referred to the house of Judah and those connected to Jerusalem. The text reflects 19th-century restorationist currents that looked for the literal gathering of Israel, renewed prophecy, and imminent millennial events.",

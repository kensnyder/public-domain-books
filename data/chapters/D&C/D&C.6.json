  "briefOverview": "Revelation to Oliver Cowdery encouraging participation in God’s work, promising guidance, spiritual gifts, and assurance through personal revelation.",
  "summary": "The Lord announces a coming \"marvelous work\" and calls laborers to reap while the field is white, promising salvation to the faithful. He urges seeking wisdom over riches, teaching that those who ask, knock, and keep commandments will receive knowledge and unfold the mysteries of God. Oliver is affirmed to have sacred gifts and prior spiritual confirmations, is counseled to support and admonish Joseph faithfully, and to exercise his gift to bring many to truth. The Lord grants Oliver, if he desires, the gift to translate and speaks of records of His gospel kept back because of wickedness, promising that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word will be established. He assures blessings whether people accept or reject the testimony, commits to be present among the faithful, and commands them to fear not, look to Christ, and continue the work with patience, faith, hope, and charity.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation is traditionally dated to April 1829 during the early translation of the Book of Mormon, shortly after Oliver Cowdery arrived to act as Joseph Smith’s scribe. Oliver had prayed for guidance prior to meeting Joseph and sought divine confirmation regarding the work. Early Latter-day Saint history records that Oliver would later be named as one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon. The emphasis on translation and witnesses fits the period’s focus on bringing forth the Book of Mormon and preparing for the organization of the Church in 1830. The language of laboring in a harvest reflects the revivalist context of early 19th-century American Christianity, in which calls to repentance and missionary zeal were common.",
  "externalReferences": "Several phrases echo the Bible: God’s word as \"sharper than a two-edged sword\" parallels Hebrews 4:12, and the \"field is white already to harvest\" recalls John 4:35. The promise \"ask…seek…knock\" mirrors Matthew 7:7, and \"where two or three are gathered\" reflects Matthew 18:20. The principle that \"in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established\" draws on Deuteronomy 19:15 and 2 Corinthians 13:1. Christ as the light incomprehensible to darkness recalls John 1:5, and the reference to Christ’s wounds evokes John 20:27; sowing and reaping corresponds to Galatians 6:7; \"little flock\" to Luke 12:32; and \"sin no more\" to John 8:11.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The scope of the audience sometimes shifts between singular (addressing Oliver) and plural (\"my sons\"), leaving ambiguity about which instructions are strictly personal versus broadly applicable. The precise meaning and mechanism of the \"gift to translate\" and the \"keys of this gift\" are not fully defined in the text. The \"records…kept back because of wickedness\" could refer to the Book of Mormon or to other unspecified writings; the text does not identify them explicitly.",

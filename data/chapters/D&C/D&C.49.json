  "briefOverview": "A revelation commissions Sidney, Parley, and Leman to preach to the Shakers, correcting specific beliefs and affirming core doctrines of Christ, ordinances, marriage, and the Second Coming.",
  "summary": "The Lord commands Sidney Rigdon, Parley P. Pratt, and Leman Copley to preach the gospel to the Shakers, noting they seek truth only in part and must repent. He affirms that salvation comes through receiving Jesus Christ, calls all to repent, and reiterates the gospel pattern: faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost by laying on of hands. The revelation corrects certain teachings by declaring that forbidding marriage is not of God and that marriage—one man and one woman becoming one flesh—is ordained to fulfill the earth’s creation through posterity. It states that food from animals and plants is given for human use but condemns shedding blood and wasting flesh unnecessarily, and warns against economic inequality. Concerning the Second Coming, it teaches that no one knows the day or hour, that Christ will not come as a woman nor as a man traveling on the earth, and that cosmic upheavals will precede His return. Promises of divine guidance and protection accompany the commission, and prophecies of Zion’s flourishing and Jacob’s and the Lamanites’ renewal are given.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation was directed to early Latter-day Saint leaders in Ohio in 1831, where a Shaker community (United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing) lived nearby. Shakers practiced celibacy, communal property, and distinctive worship, and many revered Ann Lee as a manifestation of Christ’s second appearing. Leman Copley had former ties to the Shakers and still held some of their views, making him a bridge to that community. The instructions here address specific Shaker distinctives—celibacy, certain dietary disciplines, and beliefs about Christ’s return—while commissioning formal missionary outreach.",
  "externalReferences": "The call to preach repentance, baptism in Jesus’ name, and reception of the Holy Ghost mirrors Peter’s proclamation in Acts 2:38. The statement that no one knows the day or hour of Christ’s coming echoes Matthew 24:36. The teaching that marriage is ordained and that the two become one flesh recalls Genesis 2:24 and Jesus’ citation in Matthew 19:5; the warning against forbidding to marry and imposing food prohibitions parallels 1 Timothy 4:3–5. The imagery of the earth reeling and a trumpet sounding at the Lord’s return reflects Isaiah 24:20 and 1 Thessalonians 4:16 (see also Revelation 8:2–13).",

  "uncertainAreas": "Verse 18’s wording about meats (“whoso forbiddeth to abstain from meats”) is syntactically difficult and variously interpreted; I summarized its thrust in light of verses 19–21. The scope of “one wife” (v. 16) is presented here as the text states, though its relationship to later historical practices in the Latter-day Saint movement can be debated. The identity of the “holy men that ye know not of” (v. 8) is not specified in the text.",

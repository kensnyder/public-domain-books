  "briefOverview": "Tobit and Anna anxiously await Tobias’s return, while Raguel formally sends the newlyweds off with blessings and gifts.",
  "summary": "Tobit counts the days and grows concerned when Tobias does not return as expected, fearing something has gone wrong with Gabael or the money. Anna grieves bitterly, fasting by day and weeping at night, convinced their son has died. Meanwhile, the fourteen days of wedding celebration that Raguel had sworn are completed. Tobias asks to depart, declining Raguel’s offer to send word ahead, so Raguel gives Sarah to him along with half his goods and blesses them for a prosperous journey. Raguel exhorts Sarah to honor her in-laws, and Edna prays to see grandchildren and entrusts her daughter to Tobias with a warning not to mistreat her.",
  "externalContext": "The narrative is set during the Assyrian exile, when many Israelites lived in places like Nineveh and Media; long-distance travel between cities such as Nineveh and Ecbatana could take weeks, with no reliable communication, intensifying family anxiety. In the ancient Near East, wedding feasts could be extended, sometimes lasting a week or more; in Tobit, Raguel’s promise creates a fourteen-day celebration period. It was also customary for a bride’s family to send her off with gifts or dowry and to bestow blessings at departure, underscoring the familial and covenantal nature of marriage.",
  "externalReferences": "The fourteen-day wedding period fulfills Raguel’s earlier promise (Tobit 8:20). Raguel’s instruction that Sarah honor her in-laws echoes the broader biblical command to honor father and mother (Deuteronomy 5:16) and resonates with wisdom traditions on filial piety (Sirach 3:1–16). The send-off with blessings and gifts parallels the departure of Rebekah with family blessing and wealth (Genesis 24:59–60). Edna’s charge not to mistreat Sarah aligns with ethical exhortations on marital care (e.g., Colossians 3:19).",

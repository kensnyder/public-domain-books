  "briefOverview": "Esther courageously approaches the king after prayer; God turns his initial anger into gentleness, and he receives her with favor.",
  "summary": "After completing her prayer, Esther removes her mourning attire and dresses in royal splendor, supported by two maids. Though radiant, she is inwardly terrified as she enters the king’s presence, where he sits in awe-inspiring majesty. At first he looks at her with fierce anger, and she collapses in fear. God then changes the king’s spirit to gentleness; he rushes to support and comfort her, assures her she will not die, raises the golden scepter to her neck, and invites her to speak. Esther praises his gracious countenance as like an angel of God, but faints again, and the king and his servants continue to comfort her.",
  "externalContext": "This passage is from the Greek (Septuagint) additions to Esther, which expand the Hebrew narrative with explicit references to God, prayers, and more elaborate court scenes; many Christian traditions receive these additions as Scripture, while Jewish and some Protestant canons do not. The story is set in the Persian court, typically identified with Susa, under King Ahasuerus (often associated with Xerxes I, though the historical identification is debated). Persian court protocol, as reflected in Esther, included the danger of approaching the king unsummoned unless he extended the golden scepter. The Greek additions likely date to the Hellenistic period and emphasize divine providence more overtly than the Hebrew Masoretic text.",
  "externalReferences": "This scene parallels the Hebrew account in Esther 5:1–2, where Esther appears unsummoned and the king extends the golden scepter, and it presupposes the danger described in Esther 4:11. The explicit line “God changed the spirit of the king” echoes the theological idea of God directing rulers’ hearts (cf. Proverbs 21:1). The immediate context follows Esther’s prayer in the Greek additions (Additions to Esther 14), underlining prayer preceding action. Earlier favor shown to Esther (Esther 2:17) provides narrative background for the king’s ultimate receptivity here.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The phrase “our law applies only to the people” is ambiguous—whether it exempts the queen or is a rhetorical reassurance. The historical identification of Ahasuerus with Xerxes I is debated. The nuance of “I am your brother” may be an idiomatic term of endearment or political reassurance rather than literal kinship. The exact sequencing of the Greek additions relative to the Hebrew chapter numbering can vary across editions.",

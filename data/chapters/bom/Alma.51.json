  "chapterOsisID": "Alma.51",
  "briefOverview": "The chapter contrasts internal political division over government and law with an external military threat, showing how Moroni enforces unity and defends the republic against Amalickiah's invasion.",
  "summary": "A dispute arises in the twenty-fifth year of the judges over Chief Judge Pahoran when a faction called \"king-men\" seeks to alter the law and establish a king, while \"freemen\" support the existing government; the people uphold Pahoran. Moroni obtains authority to compel or punish the dissenters, marches against the king-men, and violently suppresses themâ€”about four thousand are killed and others forced to take up the title of liberty and defend the country. While Moroni restores internal order and readies defenses, Amalickiah leads large Lamanite forces down the eastern seaboard, capturing several fortified cities. Teancum confronts Amalickiah at Bountiful, surprises him at night, and kills him with a javelin, ending Amalickiah's campaign for that year.",
  "externalContext": "This episode occurs during the Book of Mormon period called the reign of the judges, a time when the Nephite polity alternated between systems of judges and fears of monarchy; debates about kingship versus a republic are a recurring political theme. Moroni functions as the chief military leader and protector of the republic, repeatedly organizing fortifications and citizen militias to meet Lamanite invasions. The chapter reflects ancient concerns about factionalism and how internal dissent can threaten a community's security.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter echoes earlier Book of Mormon material in which the threat of king-men and the raising of a \"title of liberty\" are introduced as responses to proposals to establish a king and as rallies for defending freedoms. Moroni's role here continues themes from previous accounts of his military preparations and fortifications, showing continuity in his leadership and strategy against Lamanite aggression.",

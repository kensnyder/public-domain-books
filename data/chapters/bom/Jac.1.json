  "chapterOsisID": "Jac.1",
  "briefOverview": "Jacob explains why he was commanded to keep the small plates, emphasizes prophetic revelation about Christ, and warns about social and moral decline among the Nephites.",
  "summary": "Jacob records that Nephi commanded him to write on the small plates a selective record of things 'most precious,' especially sacred preaching and revelations about Christ. He says they had many revelations and labored to persuade their people to come unto Christ so they might enter God’s rest, warning against provoking God as Israel did in the wilderness. Jacob also reports Nephi’s anointing of a king, Nephi’s death, and the varied family/group names among the people. He notes an early drift toward pride and worldly practices—polygamy and searching for gold and silver—and closes by identifying himself and his brother Joseph as consecrated priests who must faithfully teach, taking responsibility lest the people's blood be upon them.",
  "externalContext": "In the Book of Mormon narrative, the 'small plates' are presented as a focused, spiritual record kept alongside a larger historical record; this reflects ancient practices of maintaining multiple types of records for different purposes. The references to Nephi as leader and to the people's departure from Jerusalem place the presumed origins of these records in the broader Near Eastern/Israelite cultural world, where kingship, prophetic authority, temple teaching, and genealogical naming were significant. Polygamy and accumulation of wealth are here criticized by a priestly teacher, echoing prophetic concerns in the Hebrew Bible about social and moral corruption among kings and elites.",
  "externalReferences": "The warning about provoking God in the wilderness echoes Israel’s rebellion and God’s oath that that generation would not enter the promised land (see Numbers 14:22–23). The charge that leaders fell into practices like taking many wives recalls the narratives about David and Solomon and the negative consequences associated with kings taking many wives (compare 2 Samuel 5:13; 1 Kings 11:1–4). Jacob’s emphasis on keeping a spiritual record and engraving 'heads' of sacred matters has affinities with ancient Near Eastern and Israelite practices of preserving law, prophecy, and temple teaching in written form.",

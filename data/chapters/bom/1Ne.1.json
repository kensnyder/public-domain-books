  "briefOverview": "Nephi introduces his record and recounts his father Lehi’s initial prophetic call, visionary experiences, and rejection by the people of Jerusalem.",
  "summary": "Nephi opens by explaining his background, his intent to keep a record, and his confidence in its truth. He situates events in the first year of Zedekiah’s reign, when prophets were calling Jerusalem to repent. Lehi prays fervently for his people, sees a pillar of fire, and then receives a vision of God on His throne, One descending with extraordinary brightness, and twelve others; a book is given foretelling Jerusalem’s destruction and exile. Overcome with the Spirit, Lehi praises God’s mercy even amid judgment. Nephi states he will abridge his father’s record and notes that when Lehi testified publicly of Jerusalem’s wickedness, the coming Messiah, and redemption, the people mocked and sought his life; Nephi affirms that the Lord’s tender mercies deliver the faithful.",
  "externalContext": "The “first year of the reign of Zedekiah” corresponds to a turbulent period around the late 7th to early 6th century BCE, after Babylon installed Zedekiah as a vassal king following deportations from Jerusalem. Biblical accounts describe prophets like Jeremiah warning of Jerusalem’s impending fall and urging repentance, often facing hostility from political and religious leaders. Jerusalem was ultimately destroyed by Babylon in 586 BCE, with many inhabitants exiled. Public prophetic proclamation, visions, and symbolic actions were characteristic of ancient Israelite prophetic tradition during this time.",
  "externalReferences": "Lehi’s throne-theophany resonates with biblical throne visions such as Isaiah 6:1–3 and Micaiah’s vision of the heavenly council (1 Kings 22:19); Ezekiel 1 likewise presents a divine throne vision during the Babylonian crisis. The “pillar of fire” evokes God’s manifestation in the exodus (Exodus 13:21). The warnings of destruction and exile align with Jeremiah’s prophecies and the historical narratives of Jerusalem’s fall (e.g., Jeremiah 25:8–11; 2 Kings 25:8–12). The rejection and persecution of prophets echoes summaries like 2 Chronicles 36:15–16, which recounts Israel’s mockery of God’s messengers leading up to the exile.",

  "briefOverview": "A short record of how church leaders administer the sacrament (the bread) and the prayer used to bless it, emphasizing remembrance of Christ and a covenant commitment to keep his commandments.",
  "summary": "Moroni affirms that elders and priests minister the bread—called the flesh and blood of Christ—according to Christ's commandments and that this manner is known to be true. The officiant and the congregation kneel and pray together. The recorded prayer asks God the Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify the bread so that those who partake may remember Christ's body, witness that they take upon them the name of his Son, always remember him, keep his commandments, and thereby have his Spirit with them.",
  "externalContext": "Moroni is the final compiler/author in the Book of Mormon tradition; these two sacramental prayers (Moroni 4–5) are preserved in that book and are used liturgically in the Latter‑day Saint tradition. The ritual reflects broader early Christian practices of a memorial meal instituted by Jesus (often called the Last Supper or Eucharist), where bread symbolizes his body and remembrance and covenant are central.",
  "externalReferences": "This prayer echoes Jesus' instruction 'Do this in remembrance of me' (see Luke 22:19) and corresponds to other Book of Mormon accounts where Christ institutes a sacrament (see 3 Nephi 18:1–12). The paired prayer for the wine or water appears immediately after in Moroni 5, completing the two-part sacramental formula found in this book.",

  "chapterOsisID": "Alma.27",
  "briefOverview": "A converted Lamanite people (the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi) flee persecution and are received by the Nephites; the chapter highlights their pacifism, joy in repentance, and the Nephites' provision of refuge.",
  "summary": "After Lamanite forces fail to annihilate the Nephites, Amalekites and others renew attacks against the converted Anti-Nephi-Lehies, who refuse to take up arms and suffer violence rather than retaliate. Ammon and his brethren, moved with compassion, consult the Lord and are commanded to lead the people away from danger toward the border near Zarahemla. Ammon and his brethren meet Alma and inform the Nephite leaders; the Nephite government agrees to give the refugees the land of Jershon and to protect them. The Anti-Nephi-Lehies relocate, are numbered among the church, and become known as the people of Ammon, distinguished for honesty, zeal for God, and an unwavering refusal to shed blood, trusting in Christ and the resurrection.",
  "externalContext": "This narrative comes from the Book of Mormon, a religious text presented as a history of ancient peoples in the Americas according to its tradition. The story reflects a cultural world of tribal conflicts, land inheritance, and communal protections administered by leaders (kings and a chief judge), and it emphasizes collective covenants and visible signs of conversion. The practice of granting land for refuge and maintaining armies to protect borders mirrors ancient concerns about territory and community security.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter builds on the earlier missionary labors of Ammon and his brethren and the mass conversion and covenant of the Lamanite converts recounted in Alma 17–24, where the converts covenant to bury their weapons and refuse violence. The depiction of hope in Christ and the phrase that \"death was swallowed up\" echoes New Testament language about Christ's victory over death (compare 1 Corinthians 15:54).",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Uncertainty about the precise legal or social status referenced by \"no slaves among them\" and how that law functioned in Nephite society. Also uncertain whether the explicit wording about \"death being swallowed up\" is intended as a deliberate echo of Pauline language or a parallel theological sentiment without direct dependence. Historical dating and real-world correspondence of events to archaeology or external records remain matters of broader debate beyond the text itself.",

  "chapterOsisID": "3Ne.22",
  "briefOverview": "A prophetic promise of restoration, blessing, and protection addressed to a desolate people, using the image of a formerly barren woman who will be greatly multiplied.",
  "summary": "The chapter proclaims comfort and future increase for one who was barren or forsaken, urging enlargement of her dwelling because her descendants will inherit and repopulate the nations. God is presented as maker, husband, and redeemer who briefly hid His face in righteous anger but will show everlasting kindness and gather His people with great mercies. The covenantal language assures that God’s kindness and peace will endure even if mountains pass away, invoking the Noahic promise as a guarantee. The passage concludes with assurances of prosperity, instruction for children, establishment in righteousness, and divine protection—no weapon formed against the people shall prosper—declaring this protection the heritage of the Lord’s servants.\n",
  "externalContext": "In the context of the Book of Mormon, 3 Nephi records Christ teaching the Nephites after his resurrection; this chapter is a quotation/paraphrase of Isaiah material addressed to that audience. The imagery of a barren woman becoming fruitful and of God as husband is a common prophetic metaphor in ancient Israelite literature for restoration of a covenant community after exile or judgment. References to the waters of Noah allude to the Genesis flood covenant, a well-known ancient Near Eastern motif used to guarantee divine promises.",
  "externalReferences": "This chapter closely parallels Isaiah 54:1–17 in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, sharing many phrases and themes (e.g., “Sing, O barren,” “thy maker, thy husband,” and “no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper”). The reference to the waters of Noah echoes Genesis 9:11, where God swears not to destroy the earth by flood again, and functions here as a symbol of an irrevocable divine promise.",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "How can the image of the ‘barren’ becoming fruitful encourage communities or individuals recovering from loss or marginalization today?",
    "What does the promise ‘no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper’ imply about the relationship between divine protection and human action or righteousness?",
    "In what ways can the assurance that ‘all thy children shall be taught of the Lord’ shape priorities for family and communal education today?",
    "How should believers interpret and apply promises of long-term covenantal security alongside experiences of suffering or apparent divine hiddenness?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "This chapter is a close rendering of Isaiah material; uncertainty remains about how the quotation was transmitted or adapted in this setting and whether phrases should be read as unconditional promises or as conditioned by the people’s covenant status. The scope of the protective promises (individual vs. corporate, present vs. eschatological) is also open to interpretation.",

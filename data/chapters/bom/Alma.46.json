  "chapterOsisID": "Alma.46",
  "briefOverview": "A crisis of internal dissent threatens Nephite liberty, and Moroni rallies believers with a symbolic 'title of liberty' to defend their religion and freedoms.",
  "summary": "Amalickiah stirs up dissent among the Nephites, seeking to become king and to destroy the church and the free government. Moroni responds angrily, tears his coat, writes a rallying inscription, fastens it to a pole (the 'title of liberty'), and prays for the preservation of religion and freedom. He gathers and rallies those who covenant to maintain their rights and the name of Christ; many cast their garments at his feet as a token of their vow. Amalickiah and his followers flee to the land of Nephi, while Moroni pursues and captures most dissenters, executing a few who refuse the covenant. Moroni orders the title of liberty displayed on all towers, restoring peace for several years, and Helaman maintains church order; many die in the faith during this period.",
  "externalContext": "The narrative belongs to the Book of Mormon's account of Nephite–Lamanite conflict and internal political struggle under a system of judges rather than monarchy. Ancient Near Eastern and early American republican anxieties about kingship inform the story: Amalickiah's attempt to become king is portrayed as a threat to both religious and civil liberty. The use of covenant tokens and public standards (banners) fits wider ancient practices where visible signs and oaths united communities.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter explicitly echoes the Old Testament story of Joseph’s coat being torn by his brothers (Genesis 37:23–24) and Jacob’s later blessings and prophetic language about a remnant of Joseph (see Genesis 48:19–20), which Moroni invokes to warn against a remnant’s destruction. The theme of a preserved remnant also parallels prophetic language in Isaiah about a faithful remnant that returns to God (e.g., Isaiah 10:20–21). Within the Book of Mormon narrative, these events continue the military and political conflicts treated in the preceding Alma war chapters (see Alma 43–44).",

  "uncertainAreas": "Degree to which Old Testament references are being used directly versus as thematic echoes; precise later Book of Mormon cross-references to Moroni's standards beyond Alma 46 (I relied on nearby Alma chapters but did not enumerate all later mentions).",

  "chapterOsisID": "2Ne.22",
  "briefOverview": "A short song of thanksgiving celebrating God as the source of salvation, strength, and joy and exhorting Zion to praise and proclaim his deeds.",
  "summary": "The speaker declares praise to the Lord because divine anger has passed and God has brought comfort and salvation. God is named as strength and song, and the people are invited to draw joyfully from the \"wells of salvation.\" The chapter urges public praise—calling on God’s name, declaring his deeds, and singing—because God’s great works are known and the Holy One of Israel dwells among his people.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter in 2 Nephi is a direct quotation of Isaiah 12, embedded in Nephi’s larger use of Isaiah’s prophecies. Isaiah’s songs of thanksgiving likely reflect the ancient Near Eastern prophetic tradition of hymns composed after deliverance events; later readers (including Book of Mormon authors) read them as both historical and messianic, applying them to Israel’s future redemption and to Christ.",
  "externalReferences": "The passage corresponds closely to Isaiah 12:1–6 (same language of \"in that day,\" wells of salvation, and praise). Its description \"the Lord is my strength and my song; he also has become my salvation\" echoes earlier Hebrew praise language such as Exodus 15:2 and Psalm 118:14, which celebrate God’s rescue. New Testament canticles of praise, e.g., Mary’s Magnificat (Luke 1:46–55), share the theme of rejoicing in God’s saving action.",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "When have I experienced a reversal from fear to trust that calls for public praise?",
    "What would it look like today to \"draw water out of the wells of salvation\"—what practices nourish my trust in God?",
    "How can I or my community more regularly declare and teach about God’s deeds among people?",
    "In what ways does recognizing \"the Holy One in the midst\" change communal life and worship?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The precise referent of \"in that day\" is ambiguous—either an immediate act of deliverance, a messianic/eschatological future, or a general theological summons. Also uncertain is whether the imagery (\"wells of salvation\") has a specific historical cultic reference here or functions primarily as a poetic metaphor.",

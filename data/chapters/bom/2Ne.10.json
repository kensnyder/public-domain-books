  "chapterOsisID": "2Ne.10",
  "briefOverview": "Jacob prophesies of Christ’s coming among the Jews, the scattering and future gathering of Israel, and covenant promises tied to a consecrated land, then exhorts his people to choose life through God’s grace.",
  "summary": "Jacob declares that although many of their descendants will perish because of unbelief, God will be merciful and restore many to the knowledge of their Redeemer. He testifies—based on an angelic message—that the Messiah’s name is Christ, that He will minister among the Jews, and that because of iniquity and priestcrafts He will be crucified, leading to the Jews’ destructions and scattering. Yet God covenants that when they believe in Christ they will be gathered and restored to their lands of inheritance, aided by Gentile nations whose leaders will nurture them. Jacob prophesies that “this land” will be a land of inheritance and liberty for Gentiles, with no kings raised up over them; God will defend it, and those who fight against Zion will perish as He destroys secret works of darkness. The Lord will both afflict Jacob’s seed by the Gentiles and soften the Gentiles’ hearts so they become as a father to them, and the land will be consecrated to Jacob’s seed and all who are numbered with them. Jacob encourages his people not to be downcast, reminding them of God’s guidance across the sea and His remembrance of all scattered Israelites, including those on the “isles of the sea.” He concludes by urging them to exercise moral agency, reconcile themselves to God, and remember that salvation is only through the grace of God in the resurrection and atonement.",
  "externalContext": "Within the Book of Mormon narrative, Jacob is the brother of Nephi and a priestly teacher among the early Nephites who left Jerusalem around the 6th century BCE and settled across the sea. The chapter speaks of the scattering of the Jews, a theme rooted in Israel’s covenant history and later events such as exiles and dispersions that culminated in widespread diaspora communities. The language of “kings and queens” nursing Israel echoes Isaiah’s imagery of Gentile assistance in Israel’s restoration, familiar to ancient Judahite audiences steeped in prophetic literature. “Gentiles” in this text refers broadly to non-Israelite nations, a common biblical usage.",
  "externalReferences": "The promise that Gentile kings and queens will nurture Israel directly echoes Isaiah 49:22–23, and the worldwide gathering of Israel resonates with Isaiah 11:11–12 and Deuteronomy 30:1–5. The foretold crucifixion of Christ among the Jews aligns with the Gospel narratives (e.g., Luke 23:33; John 19:16–18). The maxim “he that is not with me is against me” parallels Jesus’ teaching in Luke 11:23, and the emphasis on moral agency recalls 2 Nephi 2:27 within the same record.",

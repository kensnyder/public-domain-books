  "chapterOsisID": "1Ne.21",
  "briefOverview": "A prophetic servant is called to restore Israel and become a light to the Gentiles, assuring Zion of God’s unfailing remembrance and ultimate deliverance. The chapter promises return, compassion, and vindication for the scattered house of Israel.",
  "summary": "A servant, called from the womb and empowered by God, laments apparent failure yet is commissioned not only to restore Israel but also to be a light to the Gentiles and God’s salvation to the ends of the earth. God pledges to preserve the servant, establish the land, free prisoners, and guide the people tenderly so they will neither hunger nor thirst. The scattered will gather from distant places, and creation is called to rejoice as the Lord comforts His afflicted people. Though Zion fears being forgotten, God declares He has engraved her on His palms and will reverse her desolation with an overflowing population. The nations (even kings and queens) will assist in returning Zion’s children, and those who oppress Israel will be judged. All will know the Lord as Savior and Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter closely parallels Isaiah 49, often identified as the second of the “Servant Songs” (Isaiah 42; 49; 50; 52–53), generally dated to the exilic or early post-exilic period when Judah grappled with Babylonian displacement and hopes for restoration. The language of islands and distant lands reflects the ancient Near Eastern worldview of scattered diaspora communities. “Sinim” (v. 12) likely denotes a far-off region; its precise identification is debated among scholars. In the Book of Mormon, Nephi quotes Isaiah extensively to reassure his family and posterity about covenant promises despite their own dispersion from Jerusalem.",

    "Where do I feel discouraged in service, and how can I entrust outcomes to God as the servant does?",
    "How can I act as a light to those beyond my usual community or comfort zone?",
    "When I feel forgotten, what practices help me remember God’s steadfast regard?",
    "In what ways can I support the gathering and healing of scattered or marginalized people?",
    "How can I wait faithfully (“not be ashamed that wait for me”) when deliverance is delayed?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The identity of the servant (collective Israel, an ideal prophetic figure, or a messianic individual) is not specified and can be read multiple ways within the chapter. The location of “Sinim” (v. 12) is uncertain. Some wording differs from the King James Version of Isaiah (e.g., v. 13’s phrase about “the feet of those who are in the east”), making precise textual relationships and implications difficult to determine.",

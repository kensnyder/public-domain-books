  "chapterOsisID": "Alma.25",
  "briefOverview": "Alma 25 recounts renewed warfare and persecution among Lamanites and Nephites, the persecution and scattering of the priestly line of Amulon, and the conversion and covenantal commitment of many Lamanites who join the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.",
  "summary": "The Lamanites, enraged by previous events, wage war against Nephite towns and kill many, including nearly all the descendants or followers of Amulon; the surviving remnant flee and persecute converts in the wilderness. Many Lamanites in the wilderness, remembering the teachings of Aaron and his brethren, abandon their ancestral traditions and convert to the Lord, but the remnant of Amulon persecute and put to death believers, provoking internal bloodshed and flight. The chapter presents these killings and huntings as a fulfillment of Abinadi’s earlier prophecy that the priests’ seed would be scattered and suffer as he did by fire. When the Lamanites finally retreat, many come to dwell with the Anti-Nephi-Lehi people, bury their weapons, and live righteously. They keep the law of Moses for a time as a typological practice pointing to Christ, holding hope in the spirit of prophecy, and the missionary leaders (Ammon, Aaron, Omner, Himni, and brethren) rejoice over the success of their ministry.",
  "externalContext": "Within the Book of Mormon narrative, this episode continues a larger cycle of missionary outreach, mass conversion, and intermittent warfare between Nephites and Lamanites. Abinadi was an earlier prophetic figure (in the Mosiah narrative) who confronted King Noah’s court and was executed by fire; his words about the fate of the priests of Noah are quoted here as fulfilled. The practice of keeping the law of Moses as a typological or preparatory system is consistent with ancient Israelite religious practice, where ritual law pointed forward to expected messianic fulfillment.",
  "externalReferences": "The reference to Abinadi and the prediction that the priests’ seed would be scattered and suffer echoes Abinadi’s confrontation and martyrdom recorded in Mosiah 17–18. The conversion of the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi and their covenant to bury weapons and cease warfare is narrated more fully in Alma 23–24. The chapter’s statement that the law of Moses is a type pointing to Christ resonates with New Testament teaching of the law as a shadow of things to come (cf. Hebrews 10:1), and the expectation that Christ’s coming will fulfill those types is realized in the Book of Mormon narrative of Christ’s appearance (see 3 Nephi 11:10–11).",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text is not explicit whether “seed of Amulon” refers strictly to biological descendants or to ideological followers; the precise chronology and geographic detail of some movements are summarized rather than detailed; the phrase that the law of Moses was “not all fulfilled” leaves room for interpretation about which aspects were still in force and how contemporaries understood typology.",

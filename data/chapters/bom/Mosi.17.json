  "chapterOsisID": "Mosi.17",
  "briefOverview": "The chapter recounts the arrest, refusal to recant, and execution of the prophet Abinadi and introduces Alma as a believer who preserves Abinadi’s words. It emphasizes prophetic witness, judgment on the wicked, and the cost of faithful testimony.",
  "summary": "After finishing his testimony, Abinadi is seized on the king’s orders and brought before King Noah. A young man named Alma believes Abinadi and pleads for his safety, but the king ejects Alma and seeks to kill him; Alma flees and secretly records Abinadi’s words. Abinadi refuses to retract his accusations that God will come among men and insists his words are true, warning that if he is killed innocent blood will testify against them. Though the king momentarily fears divine judgment, priests press him to act and Abinadi is scourged and burned. While dying, Abinadi prophesies calamities—disease, scattering, and vengeance—against those who destroy God’s people, and he seals his testimony with his martyrdom.",
  "externalContext": "This narrative is in the Book of Mormon, presented as a record of events among the Nephite people in the ancient Americas. In the text’s cultural setting, kings and priestly counselors often held intertwined political and religious power, and prophets who called out elite corruption risked violent reprisals. Martyrdom of prophets functions here as a sign that God’s messengers are rejected by corrupt leadership, a motif familiar in earlier prophetic traditions.",
  "externalReferences": "Abinadi’s broader teachings and theological arguments appear in the surrounding chapters (Mosiah 12–16), where he articulates themes about the coming of Christ and the atonement. Alma’s conversion and his later role founding a covenant community are recounted beginning in Mosiah 18, where the young believer’s actions set in motion an organized dissent from King Noah’s regime.",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "How should communities respond when someone speaks an unpopular moral or religious warning?",
    "What responsibilities do religious or civic leaders have when accused of wrongdoing, and how do we guard against corrupt counsel?",
    "How can contemporary believers preserve and transmit the testimony of persecuted witnesses?",
    "What personal costs are we willing to accept for fidelity to conscience or conviction?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Uncertainty exists about the precise historical dating and geographic specifics of the events as presented in the Book of Mormon narrative. It is also ambiguous whether Abinadi’s prophecies refer mainly to immediate consequences for King Noah’s household or to broader, later fulfillments; the text supports both immediate and future readings.",

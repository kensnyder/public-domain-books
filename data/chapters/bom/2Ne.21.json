  "chapterOsisID": "2Ne.21",
  "briefOverview": "A messianic prophecy describing a righteous leader from David’s line who brings just rule, universal peace, and the gathering of Israel in a renewed, glorious rest.",
  "summary": "Verses 1–9 present a figure from the stem of Jesse endowed with the Spirit of the Lord (wisdom, counsel, might, knowledge, fear of the Lord) who will judge righteously and establish a peaceful, renewed creation where predators and prey coexist and children are safe. Verses 10–16 shift to the role of this 'root of Jesse' as an ensign to which Gentiles will seek, and portray the Lord’s 'second' setting of his hand to gather the remnant of Israel from many lands. The chapter concludes with imagery of God providing a secure way for the remnant, likening the future deliverance to Israel’s exodus from Egypt.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter closely parallels Isaiah 11 (an eighth-century BCE prophetic tradition) and reflects common Israelite hopes for a Davidic restoration after periods of exile and oppression. Imagery like the 'stem of Jesse' ties the promised leader to Jesse, father of King David, anchoring expectations in the royal dynasty. Themes of universal peace and the gathering of dispersed Israel were later reused in Jewish and Christian eschatological thought and in Second Temple literature.",
  "externalReferences": "The language and structure correspond closely to Isaiah 11:1–16, which also pictures a Davidic shoot, the Spirit resting upon him, animal peace imagery, and a future gathering of Israel. The description of people passing 'over dry shod' by God’s act echoes the Exodus crossing (see Exodus 14:21–22), where Israel crossed the Red Sea on dry ground during the deliverance from Egypt.",

    "How does the portrait of a leader 'with the Spirit' inform our expectations for moral and spiritual leadership today?",
    "What responsibilities do individuals and communities have in pursuing the kind of peace among peoples and creation depicted here?",

    "How should we read the violent images of judgment (e.g., 'slay the wicked') alongside the nonviolent peace imagery?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Some phrases are open to interpretation: 'the second time' may refer to a renewed gathering, a messianic intervention, or other eschatological events; the list of nations (Pathros, Shinar, etc.) reflects ancient geography whose precise modern referents and intended chronological scope are debated; the literal versus symbolic status of the animal peace imagery is not specified.",

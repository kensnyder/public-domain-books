  "chapterOsisID": "2Ne.32",
  "briefOverview": "Nephi teaches that the Holy Ghost reveals Christ's words and directs believers, and he exhorts continual prayer and consecration of actions to God.",
  "summary": "Nephi reminds his readers that speaking with the \"tongue of angels\" comes by the Holy Ghost and that angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost, which communicates the words of Christ. He urges his listeners to \"feast upon the words of Christ,\" because those words will tell them what to do, and warns that failure to ask and knock will leave them in darkness. Nephi identifies receiving the Holy Ghost and following its guidance as central to \"the doctrine of Christ,\" and he says no further doctrine will be given until Christ manifests himself in the flesh. He expresses grief over human unbelief and inability to receive plain knowledge, then commands that people must pray always, not faint, and pray first that their works be consecrated to the welfare of their souls.",
  "externalContext": "2 Nephi is presented as part of a larger record kept by Nephi, a prophet among the early Nephites; these chapters are his final teachings before the record passes to later writers. The language and concerns—authority of revelation, role of angels, and emphasis on prayer—reflect common ancient Near Eastern and early Judeo-Christian emphases on prophetic mediation and ongoing spiritual guidance.",
  "externalReferences": "The instruction to \"ask, knock\" parallels Jesus' teaching in Matthew 7:7 about persistent seeking. The phrase \"tongue of angels\" resonates with Paul's image in 1 Corinthians 13:1 about speaking with the tongues of men and of angels. The promise that the Spirit will teach and remind echoes John 14:26, where the Comforter teaches and brings remembrance. The exhortation to pray always and not faint has parallels in Luke 18:1's parable urging persistent prayer and in 3 Nephi 18:19–21, which in the Book of Mormon also emphasizes constant prayer and seeking God's guidance.",

    "How can I \"feast upon the words of Christ\" in my daily reading and make those words direct my decisions?",
    "What practices help me recognize and follow promptings I attribute to the Holy Ghost?",
    "In what ways can I 'pray always' without letting prayer become rote or disconnected from real-life actions?",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Whether \"tongue of angels\" is meant as a literal angelic language or a metaphor for inspired speech is ambiguous. The phrase \"no more doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh\" could be read as time-specific to Nephi's audience (anticipating Christ's mortal ministry) or as a broader theological claim; the text itself does not fully clarify the intended scope.",

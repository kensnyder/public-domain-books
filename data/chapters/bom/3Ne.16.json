  "chapterOsisID": "3Ne.16",
  "briefOverview": "Christ tells the Nephite listeners about other peoples to whom he will minister, explains how the gospel will move between Gentiles and Israel, and warns Gentiles about pride and rejection of the fulness of the gospel.",
  "summary": "Jesus announces that he has “other sheep” who have not yet heard him and that he will go to them so there may be one fold and one shepherd. He commands that these sayings be written so they can be preserved and later manifested to the Gentiles; through the fulness of the Gentiles the scattered remnant of Israel may be brought to a knowledge of the Redeemer. The Savior pronounces blessing on Gentiles who believe, but warns that if the Gentiles become prideful, sinful, and reject the fulness of the gospel, the fulness will be taken from them and restored to the house of Israel. If the Gentiles repent they may be numbered with Israel; if they do not, they will be trampled by Israel like salt that has lost its savor. The chapter closes by affirming that this land is given to the present people as an inheritance and by citing prophecy from Isaiah about the restoration and joy of Zion.",
  "externalContext": "The Book of Mormon presents itself as an ancient record of peoples in the Americas who encountered the resurrected Christ; 3 Nephi narrates his post‑resurrection ministry there. In the wider 19th‑century context of the book’s publication, themes of promised restoration and the gathering of Israel were central to American religious discourse and to Latter‑day Saint identity. The chapter’s use of “Gentiles” and “house of Israel” reflects longstanding Jewish and Christian categories for non‑Israel peoples and covenant descendants.",
  "externalReferences": "The declaration about \"other sheep\" echoes Jesus' earlier saying in John 10:16, \"other sheep I have which are not of this fold,\" which likewise speaks of one fold and one shepherd. The quoted prophetic lines at the end correspond to Isaiah 52:8–10 (Hebrew/Christian numbering), which celebrates watchmen and the revelation of God’s salvation to the ends of the earth. Within the Book of Mormon, nearby chapters (e.g., 3 Nephi 15 and 21–22) also treat the themes of the fulness being given to or taken from the Gentiles and the eventual gathering of Israel.",

    "What responsibilities do believers have to preserve and share sacred teachings so they can reach those who have not heard?",

    "In what ways does the chapter’s promise that repentance can restore status among God’s people shape approaches to inclusion and outreach?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The precise identity of the \"other sheep\" and the mechanics of the \"fulness of the Gentiles\" being given or taken away are open to interpretive variation. Also, references to \"this land\" and which contemporaneous peoples are meant are grounded in Book of Mormon narrative claims and may be read differently across traditions.",

  "chapterOsisID": "Jac.6",
  "briefOverview": "Jacob invokes the prophecy of Zenos (the olive-tree allegory) to warn that its fulfillment is certain and to urge his people to repent before divine judgment. He contrasts God’s mercy with the peril of hardening one’s heart and warns of final punishment for the unrepentant.",
  "summary": "Jacob begins by affirming that Zenos’s allegory of the tame olive tree (recorded earlier) will surely come to pass and that a future, decisive effort to ‘recover his people’ will precede the end. He promises blessing for those who labor in God’s vineyard and curses for those cast out, while emphasizing that God continually extends mercy even though the people are stiffnecked. Jacob exhorts his listeners to repent now, to cleave to God, and not to harden their hearts while mercy is offered. He warns that rejecting the prophets, the words concerning Christ, and the Holy Spirit leads to shame before God and, according to justice, to the ‘‘lake of fire and brimstone’’—endless torment. The chapter closes with a plea to enter the strait gate, continue in the narrow way to obtain eternal life, a brief admonition to be wise, and a final farewell until the judgment before God’s bar.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter is part of the Book of Mormon and is attributed to Jacob, a Nephite prophet and brother of Nephi, writing to his people. The prophet Zenos, whose allegory of the olive tree Jacob cites, is named in the Book of Mormon but does not appear in the Hebrew Bible; his allegory is recorded at length in the immediately preceding chapter (Jacob 5). The olive-tree and vineyard imagery has deep roots in ancient Israelite prophetic literature (for example, Isaiah’s vineyard song) and is used here to symbolize God’s relationship to Israel and his restorative work.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter explicitly builds on the olive-tree allegory narrated in Jacob 5, treating its promised ‘‘second time’’ of gathering and pruning as imminent. The themes of redemption, resurrection, justice, and mercy recall other Book of Mormon treatments of the atonement and resurrection, notably 2 Nephi 9 (which discusses the need for an infinite atonement and resurrection). The vineyard imagery also echoes Isaiah 5:1–7, which uses a vineyard to critique Israel’s unfaithfulness.",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The identity and wider corpus of the prophet Zenos are not attested outside the Book of Mormon, leaving questions about his historical provenance. The phrase ‘‘set his hand again the second time to recover his people’’ is ambiguous as to whether it refers to a messianic act, a latter-day restoration, or another epochal event. The language about the ‘‘lake of fire and brimstone’’ leaves open debate about literal versus metaphorical readings and about the scope of ‘endless torment.’",

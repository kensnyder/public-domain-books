  "chapterOsisID": "2Ne.18",
  "briefOverview": "A prophetic warning of imminent Assyrian judgment signified by a named child, coupled with an exhortation to fear and trust God rather than foreign alliances or necromancers.",
  "summary": "The Lord commands a record of a prophetic sign-child named Maher-shalal-hash-baz, whose early infancy signals the swift seizure of Damascus and Samaria by Assyria. The prophecy rebukes Judah for trusting in the alliance with Rezin and the son of Remaliah and foretells the overwhelming advance of the Assyrian king across the land, even reaching 'Immanuel.' The people are warned that collective counsels and spoken words will fail because God is with us, and they are instructed not to join in confederacies or to fear like the people around them. The Lord will be a sanctuary for some and a stone of stumbling for others; many will be ensnared and fall. The speaker (and his children) are declared to be signs and wonders from the Lord, and the people are admonished not to consult mediums or wizards but to rely on the law and the testimony; those who do not speak according to this word lack light and will be driven into darkness and distress.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter closely parallels Isaiah 8 and reflects the Syro-Ephraimite crisis of the late 8th century BCE, when Syria (Rezin) and the northern kingdom Israel (led by Pekah, 'Remaliah's son') opposed Judah and sought to replace Ahaz. Assyria, under rulers such as Tiglath-Pileser III, was the rising imperial power whose campaigns ultimately took Damascus and parts of Israel. Naming children with prophetic or symbolic names (e.g., Immanuel, Maher-shalal-hash-baz) was a known prophetic practice in the ancient Near East to communicate impending events.",
  "externalReferences": "This passage closely corresponds to Isaiah 8:1–22 and connects with Isaiah 7:14's Immanuel theme (cf. Isaiah 7:14). The prohibition against seeking 'familiar spirits' and wizards echoes Deuteronomy 18:10–12, which condemns divination and necromancy in Israelite law.",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The chapter is a near-verbatim rendering of Isaiah material (Isaiah 8), so questions arise about how Nephi is positioning Isaiah's prophecy in his own context. It is unclear whether 'Immanuel' is intended here strictly as a contemporary sign-child, as a longer-term messianic figure, or both. The exact referent of 'the children whom the Lord hath given me' — whether literal offspring only or symbolic representatives — is ambiguous. I have assumed historical identifications (Rezin, Remaliah's son) consistent with Isaiah scholarship but avoided speculative dating beyond that.",

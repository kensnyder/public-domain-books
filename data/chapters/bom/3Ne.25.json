  "chapterOsisID": "3Ne.25",
  "briefOverview": "A prophetic warning about the coming day of the Lord that will purge the wicked and bless the faithful, followed by a promise that Elijah will be sent to bring familial reconciliation before that day.",
  "summary": "Verses 1–3 warn that a coming day will burn up the proud and wicked, leaving none of them, while promising that those who fear God's name will be healed and arise as the righteous, trampling the wicked. Verse 4 recalls the law of Moses given at Horeb with its statutes and judgments. Verses 5–6 declare that Elijah will be sent before the great and dreadful day of the Lord to turn the hearts of fathers to children and children to fathers, so that the earth will not be smitten with a curse.",
  "externalContext": "The language and content closely parallel the Hebrew prophetic book of Malachi (often dated to the post-exilic period), which anticipates a purifying 'day of the Lord' and an Elijah-like preparer of the people. In Second Temple Jewish expectation and later Christian interpretation, the coming of Elijah (or an Elijah-like figure) is associated with preparation for divine judgment or the arrival of the messianic age.",
  "externalReferences": "This chapter corresponds closely to Malachi 4:1–6 (Malachi 3:19–24 in some traditions), which uses similar imagery of burning judgment, the 'sun (or Son) of righteousness' with healing, and the sending of Elijah. The New Testament links the Elijah role to John the Baptist (see Matthew 11:14; 17:10–13; Luke 1:17), treating the Elijah figure as a forerunner who restores relationships and prepares people for the Lord.",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "How does the warning of a purifying 'day of the Lord' shape the way I live ethically and spiritually today?",
    "In what concrete ways can families and communities work toward the reconciliation described as 'turning the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers'?",
    "What does 'remember the law of Moses' mean for believers who do not observe Mosaic ritual law—should it be read as moral, historical, or covenantal instruction?",
    "How should we discern whether a prophetic promise is to be expected as literal fulfillment, typological fulfillment (e.g., John the Baptist), or both?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Whether 'Son of Righteousness' is a textual variant of 'Sun of Righteousness' and its precise messianic implications; whether the reference to Elijah intends the literal prophet Elijah's return, an Elijah-like forerunner, or both; how the injunction to 'remember the law of Moses' is meant to function for the immediate audience versus later readers.",

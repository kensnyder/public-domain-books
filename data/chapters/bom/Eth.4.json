  "chapterOsisID": "Eth.4",
  "briefOverview": "A short editorial by the narrator explaining why visionary records were written, sealed, and withheld, followed by a prophetic invitation to repent so that hidden revelation may be manifested.",
  "summary": "The narrator reports that the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to record his visions and that those records were to be kept hidden until after Christ had been lifted up on the cross; King Mosiah preserved them until Christ later showed himself to the people. After Christ's appearance the records were to be made manifest, but because of ongoing unbelief many have rejected the gospel, so the narrator is commanded to hide and seal the records again—including the interpreters—until the Gentiles repent. The Lord promises that when the Gentiles exercise faith like the brother of Jared, and when Israel breaks the 'veil of unbelief' with contrition and prayer, the hidden revelations (including those written by John) will be unfolded. The chapter contains strong assertions of Christ's identity and power, warnings (accursed are those who deny or contend), and a final call to repentance, baptism, and faith with the promise of salvation and signs for believers.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter functions as an editorial comment within the Book of Ether and is part of the larger Book of Mormon narrative; it reflects the ancient-American framing of prophetic records that are sealed and later unsealed by later authors (notably Moroni). The idea of sealed records and delayed revelation has parallels in other ancient and apocalyptic literatures, where certain revelations are kept hidden until an appointed time.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter directly echoes and presupposes the earlier account of the brother of Jared's visionary encounter (see Ether 3) when it refers to what he 'saw' and the power of those revelations. Its promise that Christ 'showed himself unto his people' and subsequent teachings about baptism and signs align with the Book of Mormon account of Christ's post-resurrection visit (see 3 Nephi 11). The appeal to 'my servant John' and 'my revelations... written by my servant John' calls to mind the New Testament tradition of John the Revelator (e.g., Revelation 1) and, within the Book of Mormon canon, is consistent with later invitations to seek personal confirmation of truth (see Moroni 10:4–5).",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The precise meaning of phrases like 'I am the Father' (Christ identifying himself as Father) and the full theological implications are complex and can be interpreted in multiple ways; the intended referent of 'Gentiles' (which groups are meant) is not explicitly defined here; the phrase 'sealed up the interpreters' is symbolic and its exact mechanism is not explained in the chapter.",

  "chapterOsisID": "3Ne.7",
  "briefOverview": "A period of political collapse and factionalism among the Nephites is followed by Nephi’s prophetic ministry, miracles, and the establishment of baptism for those who repent.",
  "summary": "After the murder of the chief judge, the people fragment into large kin-based tribes and abandon unified government, driven by secret combinations and hatred of prophetic witnesses. A faction installs a man named Jacob as king and withdraws northward to build a rival kingdom. Despite an agreement to avoid intertribal war, righteousness declines and many reject and persecute prophets. Nephi, who has been given prophetic authority and visions of Christ, preaches repentance and performs powerful miracles—casting out evil spirits and even raising his brother from the dead—which provokes anger among many. Conversions are relatively few, but those who repent are baptized with water as a public sign of repentance and remission of sins, and priests are ordained to administer this ordinance.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter comes from the Book of Mormon narrative, which portrays post-resurrection visits of Jesus to the peoples described in that record and the subsequent social and political upheavals. The social pattern of large, kin-based tribes led by chiefs and the dangers posed by clandestine political conspiracies (\"secret combinations\") reflect concerns about factionalism and elite manipulation common in ancient and early-modern texts describing polities without centralized authority.",
  "externalReferences": "The simile \"like the dog to his vomit\" echoes Proverbs 26:11’s imagery about returning to folly. The emphasis on repentance accompanied by water baptism aligns with New Testament practice and teaching about baptism as a sign of repentance (compare Matthew 3:6; Acts 2:38). Nephi’s casting out of devils, healings, and raising the dead find parallels in Gospel accounts of Jesus’ miracles (e.g., Mark 5:35–42), while angels ministering to a prophet recalls scenes such as Matthew 4:11.",

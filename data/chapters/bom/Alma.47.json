  "chapterOsisID": "Alma.47",
  "briefOverview": "A narrative of political intrigue in which Amalickiah uses deceit, bribery, and murder to seize leadership among the Lamanites and to secure power over Nephite territory.",
  "summary": "Amalickiah stirs up the Lamanites against the Nephites and is given command of a loyal contingent to compel the rest to arms, but he secretly plans to dethrone the Lamanite king. He maneuvers among the Lamanite forces at Onidah and Antipas, dupes the leader Lehonti into a tactical arrangement that lets Amalickiah deliver his own men, and then has Lehonti slowly poisoned so that Amalickiah is made leader. Amalickiah then arranges the assassination of the Lamanite king by a feigned gesture of peace, frames the royal servants so they flee to Zarahemla and join the people of Ammon, and enters the city Nephi to take possession. He secures his rule by marrying the queen and is acknowledged king over the Lamanites and dissenter groups. The chapter closes by noting that the dissenters—though instructed in Nephite teachings—have become more hardened, wicked, and forgetful of God.",
  "externalContext": "Within the Book of Mormon narrative Amalickiah is a dissenter from Nephite society whose political ambitions escalate into open conflict; this chapter describes a turning point in which he transitions from insurgent to crowned Lamanite ruler. In many pre-modern polities, succession could be contested and was sometimes secured by assassination, bribery, or marriage alliances—tactics that the text portrays Amalickiah using. The reference to Zarahemla and the people of Ammon signals movement between major population centers and alliances that matter strategically in the larger narrative.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter's portrayal of political assassination and treachery parallels biblical narratives of violent succession struggles (for example, the politically motivated killing of Abner in 2 Samuel 3:27–30). The text also echoes recurring Book of Mormon themes about dissenters who, despite prior instruction in Nephite religious teaching, fall into greater wickedness—see broader Alma-era discussions of pride, dissent, and the consequences of rebellion elsewhere in the book (e.g., the larger Alma narrative about internal contention and wars).",

  "uncertainAreas": "Precise placement of Amalickiah's wider campaign within adjacent Alma chapters and the full sequence of subsequent military responses (e.g., the immediate Nephite reactions and which commanders oppose him next) were not established solely from this chapter; I avoided citing specific Book of Mormon chapter numbers for those events because of uncertainty about their exact locations.",

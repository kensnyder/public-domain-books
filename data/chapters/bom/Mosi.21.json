  "chapterOsisID": "Mosi.21",
  "briefOverview": "A portrait of Nephite suffering under Lamanite oppression, their humbled repentance, and the arrival of Ammon which brings hope and a desire for covenant and baptism.",
  "summary": "Limhi and his people resettle in the city of Nephi but soon come under renewed Lamanite oppression; the Lamanites refrain from killing them because of an oath but impose heavy burdens. Repeated Nephite attempts to fight fail, producing mourning and many widows; the people ultimately humble themselves, cry to God, and experience a gradual easing of burdens though not immediate deliverance. The people begin to prosper modestly, care for widows, and keep watch against priests who had caused earlier troubles. Ammon and his brethren arrive, are at first arrested as suspected priests of Noah, but then welcomed when identified as brethren from Zarahemla. Messengers sent earlier to find Zarahemla had returned with a record on plates of ore from a destroyed people, and the news that King Mosiah could interpret such engravings brings joy. The people mourn past sins (king Noah, the priests, Abinadi) and many, including Limhi, covenant to serve God and desire baptism, but lack authorized priesthood to perform it and therefore wait upon the Spirit while they seek deliverance from bondage.",
  "externalContext": "The narrative is set within the larger Book of Mormon conflict between Nephites and Lamanites, where kings, priests, and oaths often shaped wartime conduct and social order. In this tradition, formal rites like baptism require authorized priesthood or divinely conferred authority, and engraved metal plates are a primary medium for preserving records. The discovery of a record from a destroyed people anticipates later material (the Jaredite record) that plays a significant role in the text's broader historical claims.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter alludes to earlier events: the ministry and execution of Abinadi (see Mosiah 17) and the corrupt reign of King Noah and his priests (see Mosiah 11–19). It also connects to Alma’s establishment of a church after separating from Noah’s people and his baptizing and organizing converts (see Mosiah 18). The plates of ore found by Limhi’s searchers correspond to the record later identified as the Jaredite record, which is treated in the Book of Ether.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The text implies the plates of ore are the Jaredite record but does not name them here; the precise identity and later fate of the priests who stole Lamanite daughters is not detailed in this chapter. Also the exact nature of Mosiah’s interpretive gift (how it functions) is described but not fully explained here.",

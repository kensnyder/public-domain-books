  "chapterOsisID": "Alma.24",
  "briefOverview": "A converted Lamanite people formally renounce violence and bury their weapons, refusing to defend themselves even when attacked; their nonresistance leads many attackers to repent and join them.",
  "summary": "Enemies (Amalekites, Amulonites, and unconverted Lamanites) prepare to wage war against the recently converted people called Anti-Nephi-Lehi. The new converts—under their king—refuse to take up arms, celebrating that God has forgiven their many murders and urging that their swords remain unstained. They bury their weapons as a public covenant to never again shed human blood and to labor rather than steal or be idle. When attacked they prostrate themselves and call on God; many are slain, but their example moves the attackers to remorse, to lay down their weapons, and to join the people of God. The chapter emphasizes the power of repentance and the way nonviolent witness can lead to mass conversion, while warning that those who fall away after enlightenment may become more hardened.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter is set within the Nephite-Lamanite narrative of the Book of Mormon (traditionally placed in the Americas in the first millennium BC in the internal chronology). The groups named (Nephites, Lamanites, Amalekites, Amulonites) represent interrelated ethnic and religious factions within that narrative. The episode follows missionary efforts led by Ammon and others, who won a large-scale conversion among a Lamanite group; the social consequences of large communal conversions (land, protection, and integration with existing polity) are themes elsewhere in the work.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter continues events begun in the previous chapter where Ammon’s mission and the conversion and renaming of the people are narrated (see Alma 23). The later migration and settlement arrangements for the converts are taken up in subsequent chapters (see Alma 27:22–24). The teaching and practice of refusing retaliation and seeking peace parallels New Testament ethical teachings such as Jesus’ instructions about non-retaliation and peacemaking (e.g., Matthew 5:38–44; 5:9).",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Uncertainty about precise historical identification and dating of named groups (Amalekites, Amulonites) and about long-term social effects beyond the chapter. Also ambiguous is the theological nuance of statements like 'they can no more be washed bright'—whether meant as literal impossibility or a cautionary hyperbole about hardening after knowledge.",

  "chapterOsisID": "Hel.7",
  "briefOverview": "Nephi, son of Helaman, mourns widespread Nephite corruption and publicly calls the people to repent, warning of divine judgment and social collapse if they refuse.",
  "summary": "Nephi returns from the land northward after being rejected there, discovers the Nephites corrupted by Gadianton robbers who control the government and pervert justice. Deeply sorrowful, he longs for earlier, more righteous times and then publicly pours out his soul from a tower in his garden, drawing a crowd. He denounces their pride, love of riches, and lawlessness, especially the secret band of Gadianton, and issues urgent calls to repent. Nephi warns that unless they turn from their wickedness the Lord will withdraw protection, they will be scattered and destroyed, and even the Lamanites may be favored over them. He closes by affirming that his words come from revelation, not his own invention.",
  "externalContext": "Within the Book of Mormon narrative, 'secret combinations' or Gadianton robbers function as organized criminal-political groups that undermine law and religious order; the judges system mentioned here replaces monarchy in Nephite governance and is portrayed as vulnerable to such corruption. Public preaching from elevated places (towers, high places by markets) and prophetic calls to repentance echo ancient Israelite prophetic practice, where prophets publicly confronted civic sins like idolatry, social injustice, and pride. The chapter reflects a common scriptural pattern linking moral failure, social injustice, and impending national disaster.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter participates in a broader prophetic tradition of public calls to repentance and warnings that resembles themes found in the Hebrew prophets (public denunciation of pride, injustice, and idolatry). Within the Book of Mormon narrative the problem of secret combinations is a recurring theme and a major causal factor for later societal collapse and warfare; this chapter is one instance of that motif's appearance and warning.",

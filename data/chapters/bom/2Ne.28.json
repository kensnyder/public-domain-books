  "chapterOsisID": "2Ne.28",
  "briefOverview": "Nephi warns about widespread apostasy: pride, corrupt churches, false doctrines, and complacency leading people away from God. He emphasizes ongoing revelation ('line upon line') and pronounces woes on those who reject spiritual truth.",
  "summary": "Nephi prophesies that in the last days many churches will be built unto themselves rather than the Lord, producing contention, false teaching, and a denial of the Holy Ghost and God's miraculous power (1–6). He describes popular worldly attitudes—'eat, drink, and be merry'—and teaching that minimizes sin and justifies small injustices, leading to pride, persecution of the poor, and moral corruption (7–14). Nephi pronounces woes on the arrogant, false teachers, and those who pervert the way of the Lord, and he foretells the fall of the 'great and abominable church' and the stirring of people either to repentance or to destruction (15–21). He warns that the devil will use deception—pacifying some into carnal security, denying hell to others, and ultimately seizing souls—and stresses that all will be judged (22–23). Finally, he repeatedly pronounces 'wo' on those complacent in Zion, those who say 'we have received, and need no more,' and teaches that God gives revelation 'line upon line' to the humble while removing it from the proud (24–32).",
  "externalContext": "Within the Book of Mormon tradition, 2 Nephi is presented as the record of a prophet (Nephi) writing prophetic warnings to his descendants and to future generations about latter-day apostasy and the need for continual revelation. The rhetoric and themes—condemnation of pride, warnings against false teachers, and appeals to repentance—fit ancient prophetic genres found in the Hebrew Bible and later Christian prophetic literature. The chapter addresses both Israelites and 'Gentiles' as receiving extended mercy if they repent, reflecting the Book of Mormon’s broader concern with covenant peoples and the latter-day missionary horizon.",
  "externalReferences": "The phrase 'line upon line, precept upon precept' echoes Isaiah 28:10 and Isaiah 28:13, where progressive instruction is described in a similar formula. The 'eat, drink, and be merry' phrase resembles the rich fool motif in Luke 12:19 and other New Testament warnings about worldly complacency. Warnings about false teachers and deception parallel Jesus’ caution against false prophets (e.g., Matthew 7:15; Matthew 24:24), while the final judgment imagery and 'lake of fire' language corresponds with Revelation 20:10,14–15.",

    "What tests or practices can help individuals and communities discern genuine spiritual witnesses from persuasive but false teaching?",
    "In what ways might modern religious or civic institutions be 'built up' unto themselves rather than to the Lord, and how should communities respond?",

    "What concrete steps can believers take to resist complacency ('All is well') and to protect and aid the poor and meek?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The identity and historical referent of the 'great and abominable church' is broader and variously interpreted (it may refer to specific institutions, systemic corruption, or symbolic spiritual power), so its precise scope is uncertain. Also, some prophetic phrases (e.g., how 'line upon line' functions in practice and which modern applications Nephi intends) allow multiple reasonable readings.",

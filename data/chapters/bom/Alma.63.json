  "chapterOsisID": "Alma.63",
  "briefOverview": "A short transitional chapter recording transfers of sacred records, deaths of leaders, and a notable northward migration by sea led by Hagoth.",
  "summary": "Shiblon receives the sacred things that Alma had delivered to Helaman and is described as a righteous man; Moroni dies, ending the thirty-sixth year. A large company moves north from Zarahemla, and Hagoth builds and launches very large ships that carry many Nephites, women, and children into the west sea toward the land northward. One ship returns and makes further voyages; some ships and their passengers are never heard from again and are supposed drowned. Shiblon later dies, and before his death he confers the sacred engravings upon Helaman (the son of Helaman). Most of the engravings are sent throughout the land except those Alma commanded be withheld. In the same period some dissenters stir up the Lamanites, who attack the people of Moronihah but are defeated and driven back.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter is set during the Nephite 'reign of the judges,' a period after the era of kings in Book of Mormon narrative when record-keeping and custodianship of metal plates were central religious duties. Long-distance sea travel is presented as notable and hazardous; the brief account of Hagoth’s ships has invited later tradition and speculation about transoceanic migrations. The custodial transfer of records (plates/engravings) reflects the text’s prioritization of preserving religious and historical materials across generations.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter’s concern with handing down sacred records connects with Alma’s instructions to Helaman about the plates elsewhere in the same book (see Alma 37:1–10), where Alma counsels diligence in preserving the records and teaching future generations. The military action and figures named (e.g., Moronihah, Moroni) also tie back to earlier Alma chapters that describe wars and the roles of these commanders in defending Nephite cities.",

    "How can communities respond to internal dissent that risks provoking external conflict?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text is terse about Hagoth’s identity and the fate of the lost ships; later traditions link Hagoth to wider migrations but the chapter itself only reports they were 'never heard of' and 'supposed' drowned. It is also brief about which specific portions Alma commanded to withhold and gives limited detail about the precise identities or offices of some named figures (e.g., which Moroni is referenced) and exact chronological dating.",

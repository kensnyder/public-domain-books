  "chapterOsisID": "Hel.5",
  "briefOverview": "Nephi relinquishes political power to focus on preaching, and he and his brother Lehi become instruments in a dramatic divine intervention that leads many Lamanites to repent. The chapter centers on Helaman’s counsel to build on Christ as a sure foundation and narrates a prison miracle marked by fire, a still voice, and widespread conversion.",
  "summary": "Seeing the people’s corruption, Nephi gives up the judgment-seat to Cezoram and chooses lifelong ministry with his brother Lehi. The narrative preserves Helaman’s counsel to his sons: keep the commandments, seek heavenly treasure, remember Benjamin’s teaching on salvation through Christ, accept repentance as the condition of redemption, and build on the rock of the Redeemer so one cannot fall. Nephi and Lehi preach powerfully across Nephite lands and among Lamanites, leading many dissenters and eight thousand Lamanites to repent and be baptized. Traveling to the land of Nephi, they are imprisoned; a miraculous pillar of fire encircles them without harm, the earth shakes, and a still, mild voice calls the captors to repent. Prompted by Aminadab, the crowd cries to God until the cloud of darkness lifts; all are encircled by fire, receive the Holy Spirit, hear a voice granting peace through faith in the “Well Beloved,” and see angels minister. About three hundred witness these events and spread the news, leading most Lamanites to accept the message, lay down weapons and hatred, and even yield lands to the Nephites.",
  "externalContext": "The Nephite system of judges, established earlier by King Mosiah, operated by the “voice of the people,” a principle that could falter when the majority embraced wickedness. Nephite–Lamanite relations in this era were marked by cycles of conflict, dissent, and missionary efforts leading to occasional large-scale conversions. Names that recall revered ancestors (like Nephi and Lehi) functioned as moral exemplars, reinforcing memory and identity. Prisons were used not only for crime but also to detain perceived political or religious threats, especially during periods of war and unrest.",
  "externalReferences": "Helaman explicitly cites King Benjamin’s teaching that salvation comes only through Christ (Mosiah 3:17). He also invokes Amulek’s words to Zeezrom that the Lord does not redeem people in their sins, but from their sins (Alma 11:34–37). The imprisonment site is identified as the same prison where Ammon and his companions were held by Limhi’s servants (Mosiah 7:7–15). The “still” and soul-piercing divine voice recalls the biblical portrayal of God’s “still small voice” to Elijah (1 Kings 19:12).",

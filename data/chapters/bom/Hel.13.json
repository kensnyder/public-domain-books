  "chapterOsisID": "Hel.13",
  "briefOverview": "A Lamanite prophet, Samuel, warns a decadent Nephite society of impending divine judgment and urges repentance, condemning their love of riches and rejection of true prophets.",
  "summary": "In a time when the Nephites have become greatly wicked while many Lamanites keep the law of Moses, Samuel the Lamanite returns to Zarahemla and preaches repentance from the city wall after being barred entry. He prophesies that unless the people repent the sword of justice will fall within four hundred years and that only faith in Jesus Christ and true repentance can save them. Samuel warns that God will withdraw his word and Spirit, that the land and hidden treasures will be cursed because of iniquity, and that riches will slip away in times of poverty. He denounces the people's preference for flattering leaders who endorse wealth and sin, condemns their persecution of prophets, and describes the eventual lament when it is too late to repent. The chapter closes with Samuel pleading that the Lord's anger be turned away and urging immediate repentance before probation ends.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter is part of the Book of Mormon narrative set among the Nephite and Lamanite peoples; prophets often play a central role in calling communities to repentance. The figure of a Lamanite prophet preaching to Nephites is significant in the book’s broader theme that righteousness is not confined to one lineage. Warnings about riches and prophetic rejection resonate with ancient Israelite prophetic literature and reflect common Near Eastern prophetic motifs (warning, conditional judgment, and call to repentance).",
  "externalReferences": "Samuel the Lamanite continues related prophecies in the next chapter (Helaman 14), where he foretells signs of the coming of Christ; those signs are reported fulfilled in 3 Nephi 1:13–21. The catastrophic signs and destruction associated with Christ’s death are narrated later in 3 Nephi 8–10, which correspond to Samuel’s warnings of smiting and desolation. The moral critique of wealthy, complacent elites and the denunciation of flattering leaders has parallels in Old Testament prophetic indictments of Jerusalem (for example, Isaiah 1:21–25).",

  "uncertainAreas": "The precise meaning and timing of the \"four hundred years\" and the reference to the \"fourth generation\" are open to interpretation (literal chronology vs. symbolic). It is also unclear how broadly the curse on \"treasures\" should be applied beyond literal lost property versus a rhetorical judgment about misplaced priorities.",

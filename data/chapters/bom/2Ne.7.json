  "chapterOsisID": "2Ne.7",
  "briefOverview": "The Lord confronts Israel about their self-caused estrangement and declares his power to redeem, while the obedient Servant models steadfast trust amid abuse. The chapter ends by contrasting trust in the Lord with reliance on one’s own “sparks.”",
  "summary": "The Lord asks Israel who issued their “divorcement,” insisting he has not sold or cast them off; rather, their iniquities brought their separation. He affirms his power to redeem, invoking imagery of drying seas and darkening heavens. A speaker identified as the Lord’s Servant declares that God has opened his ear, enabling him to comfort the weary and remain obedient even while suffering shame, beating, and spitting. Confident in divine vindication, the Servant sets his face “like a flint” against adversaries, trusting the Lord to justify him and outlast human accusers. The chapter calls those who fear the Lord to heed his Servant amid darkness, and warns those who walk by their own kindled fire that they will “lie down in sorrow.”",
  "externalContext": "This chapter closely parallels Isaiah 50, commonly situated within Isaiah 40–55, a block often associated by many scholars with an exilic context (6th century BCE). The imagery of a “bill of divorcement” and being “sold” echoes ancient Near Eastern legal practices: a formal writ to end marriage (cf. Deuteronomy 24:1) and debt-slavery when families were sold to creditors. The “Servant” motif appears repeatedly in Isaiah 40–55, addressing a figure (variously interpreted as Israel, a prophetic individual, or an ideal agent) who is taught by God and suffers on behalf of a mission. In the Book of Mormon, Nephi transmits large sections of Isaiah to his people, drawing on Isaiah’s words to teach covenant faithfulness and hope in divine deliverance.",
  "externalReferences": "The drying of the sea recalls the exodus deliverance (Exodus 14:21–31), underscoring God’s continued capacity to redeem. This passage aligns with Isaiah’s Servant Songs, especially Isaiah 42:1–9; 49:1–6; and the suffering and vindication themes culminating in Isaiah 52:13–53:12. The image of accusers perishing like a moth-eaten garment echoes Isaiah 51:8. The Servant’s experience of beating and spitting anticipates New Testament passion narratives (e.g., Matthew 26:67; Mark 14:65), which early Christians read in light of Isaiah’s Servant.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The identity of the “Servant” (prophet, collective Israel, ideal agent, or messianic figure) is not specified in the text and remains debated. The shift in speakers (Lord vs. Servant) is implied but not explicitly marked, which can affect interpretation of certain lines. The clause “I will smite him with the strength of my mouth” (v. 8) is not present in the KJV of Isaiah 50:8 and may reflect a textual variant or interpretive expansion.",

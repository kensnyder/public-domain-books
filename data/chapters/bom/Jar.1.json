  "chapterOsisID": "Jar.1",
  "briefOverview": "Jarom provides a short, intentionally limited record that highlights Nephite obedience, prophetic warning, and military preparedness during a period of recurring conflict with the Lamanites.",
  "summary": "Jarom explains that he writes briefly at his father Enos’s command so the genealogy and small-plates record will be preserved, but he will not repeat the prophetic revelations already recorded by his fathers. He observes spiritual hardness among many people but stresses that God remains merciful and that those with faith receive communion with the Holy Spirit. Over about two centuries the Nephites prospered, kept the law of Moses and the sabbath, multiplied, and developed wealth, craftsmanship, and weapons; their faithful leaders fortified cities and repelled repeated Lamanite attacks. Prophets, priests, and teachers labored with long-suffering to persuade people to repentance and to look forward to the coming Messiah, and these efforts helped prevent the Nephites’ destruction. After recounting that wars and contentions continued, Jarom closes by transferring the plates to his son Omni.",
  "externalContext": "The Book of Jarom belongs to the small-plates tradition in the Book of Mormon, a Near Eastern–derived practice of keeping concise family and spiritual records on metal plates. The Nephite–Lamanite divide is presented as a long-standing social and political conflict in the narrative. The chapter’s references to the law of Moses and the sabbath reflect the transplantation or adaptation of Israelite religious practices in the book’s claimed ancient American setting. Precise dating and archaeological correlations for these events are matters of debate among scholars.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter’s idea that obedience brings national blessing echoes covenantal promises like those in Deuteronomy 28, where obedience is linked to prosperity and protection. The instruction to keep the sabbath corresponds to Exodus 20:8–11, which sets the sabbath among the Ten Commandments. The exhortation to look forward to a coming Messiah resonates with prophetic traditions such as Isaiah 53:3–5 (the suffering servant motif) and with other prophetic passages in scriptural collections that anticipate a messianic figure.",

  "uncertainAreas": "Precise historical dating and archaeological correlation of the events, the material details (e.g., references to iron, steel, and 'machinery') in the claimed ancient American setting, and the fuller content of the 'plan of salvation' that Jarom says his fathers already revealed are areas of uncertainty. I also note some ambiguity in how broadly terms like 'Lamanites' and 'Nephites' map onto historical groups.",

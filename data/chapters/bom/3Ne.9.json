  "chapterOsisID": "3Ne.9",
  "briefOverview": "A divine proclamation of widespread judgment on wicked cities is followed by an urgent call to repentance and a clear self‑revelation of Jesus Christ as Creator, Redeemer, and the end of the sacrificial system.",
  "summary": "A voice announces woes to the people and recounts multiple cities destroyed for wickedness and for shedding the blood of prophets and saints. The speaker calls those spared to repent and be converted, promising healing and eternal life to those who come unto him. Jesus identifies himself as the Son of God, Creator, and one with the Father, and declares that the scriptures about his coming are fulfilled. He teaches that redemption comes through him, that the law of Moses is fulfilled in him, and that animal sacrifices are no longer accepted. Instead he requires a 'broken heart and a contrite spirit' and promises baptism with fire and the Holy Ghost to those who come to him in faith, inviting all ends of the earth to repent and be saved.",
  "externalContext": "Within Book of Mormon narrative tradition, this chapter is part of Jesus Christ's post‑resurrection ministry to the peoples in the Americas after a period of catastrophic destruction associated with Christ's crucifixion in Jerusalem. The denunciation of citywide destructions and the emphasis on prophetic blood reflect ancient prophetic rhetoric that links communal punishment to rejection of prophets. The instruction to abandon animal sacrifice fits within broader early Christian claims that Christ's atonement fulfills and supersedes the Mosaic temple cult.",
  "externalReferences": "The claim that the law of Moses is fulfilled in him echoes Jesus' own teaching in Matthew 5:17 and early Christian interpretation in Hebrews that the sacrificial system is completed in Christ. The self‑titles 'Alpha and Omega' and the eternal Creator role resonate with Revelation 1:8 and Revelation 22:13 as well as John 1:1–3 and Colossians 1:15–17 on the Word/Christ as agent of creation. The call to offer a 'broken heart and a contrite spirit' recalls language like Psalm 51:17 which values inner repentance over ritual sacrifice, while the promise of baptism with 'fire and with the Holy Ghost' parallels New Testament imagery in Matthew 3:11 and Acts 2:1–4 concerning Spirit baptism and empowering.",

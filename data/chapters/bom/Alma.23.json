  "chapterOsisID": "Alma.23",
  "briefOverview": "A Lamanite king converts and protects Nephite missionaries, leading to widespread Lamanite conversions and the formation of a pacifist community called the Anti‑Nephi‑Lehies.",
  "summary": "The king of the Lamanites proclaims protection for Ammon, Aaron, Omner, Himni, and their brethren so they may preach without obstruction. Aaron and his brethren establish churches, consecrate priests and teachers, and have great success; thousands of Lamanites are converted and taught Nephite records and prophecies. Those who are converted commit to righteousness and lay down their weapons of rebellion, ceasing to fight against God or their brethren. The chapter lists the cities and regions where conversions occur and notes that the Amalekites and Amulonites largely refuse to repent. The converts choose a new communal name, Anti‑Nephi‑Lehies, and become industrious and friendly with the Nephites, with the 'curse of God' no longer following them.",
  "externalContext": "In the Book of Mormon narrative, Ammon and his brethren are Nephite missionaries who earlier entered Lamanite lands (see Alma 17–22). Renaming as part of a covenant or identity shift has precedents in ancient religious traditions (e.g., biblical figures receiving new names to mark divine promises). Large-scale conversions and communal covenant commitments function in the text as markers of social and religious transformation that alter political and military relationships between groups.",
  "externalReferences": "This chapter continues the missionary story begun in Alma 17–22, where Ammon and his brothers first preach among the Lamanites and convert the Lamanite king. The later episode in Alma 24 narrates these converts burying their weapons and formally covenanting never to take them up again; Alma 27 then describes their later migration and friendship with the Nephites.\n\nThe chapter's themes of renaming and communal covenant echo other Book of Mormon passages where groups adopt new identities after conversion and deliverance (compare Alma 24 and Alma 27).",

    "How should a religious community respond when leaders take public steps toward repentance?",
    "What practices help converts integrate doctrine with changed social behavior (e.g., renouncing violence)?",
    "How can renaming or new communal identities support moral transformation today?",
    "What responsibilities do sponsoring communities have toward large groups who convert and seek protection?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text gives limited historical markers (dates, external polities), so the precise historical setting and real-world correspondences are unclear. The phrase 'curse of God did no more follow them' is ambiguous as to whether it refers primarily to spiritual, social, or material change. The identities and origins of groups named Amalekites and Amulonites are not fully explained here and require reading adjacent chapters for clarity.",

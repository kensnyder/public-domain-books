  "chapterOsisID": "2Ne.26",
  "briefOverview": "Nephi prophesies about Christ’s post‑resurrection appearance, warns of judgment on the wicked and apostate, and emphasizes God’s universal invitation and ethical commandments.",
  "summary": "Nephi predicts that after Christ’s resurrection the Savior will personally appear and speak words that become law, and he warns that many future generations will experience wars, persecution, and severe divine judgments on those who reject and kill prophets. He contrasts the fate of the persecutors—described with vivid imagery of destruction—with the preservation of the righteous who heed prophetic witness and look forward to Christ. Nephi foretells widespread convincing of Jews and Gentiles that Jesus is the Christ, the manifestation of God to all peoples through the Holy Ghost and miracles. He prophesies a period of apostasy and suffering for his descendants, including being smitten by Gentiles and besieged, yet promises that the righteous words and prayers will be preserved and that the unbelieving will not be forgotten. Nephi condemns prideful Gentile churches, secret combinations, priestcraft, and exploitation of the poor, and he reiterates core commandments and ethical injunctions. The chapter concludes by affirming God’s impartial offer of salvation to all people and that charity (love) is central to true religion; those who labor for money rather than Zion will perish.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter is situated in the longer Nephite prophetic tradition and reflects common ancient Near Eastern and Second Temple Jewish themes: divine visitation, prophetic vindication, and communal judgment. The language about God revealing himself 'by the power of the Holy Ghost' and post‑resurrection appearances parallels early Christian claims about Christ’s resurrection appearances to his followers. The critique of 'priestcraft' and corrupt religious leadership echoes broader prophetic literature that condemns religious hypocrisy and exploitation.",
  "externalReferences": "The invitation to 'buy milk and honey, without money and without price' echoes Isaiah 55:1, which uses similar imagery of freely offered sustenance to invite people to God’s provision. The phrase 'the Sun of righteousness' or 'Son of righteousness' and the promise of healing recall Malachi 4:2 (Hebrew 3:20 in some traditions) about the righteous receiving healing when the sun of righteousness rises. The prediction that Christ will show himself after his resurrection and the conviction of the Jews and Gentiles aligns with New Testament accounts of post‑resurrection appearances (e.g., John 20:19–29) and the universalizing language of John 3:16 about God’s love in giving his Son.",

    "How should communities support religious workers so they 'labor for Zion' rather than for money?",
    "In what ways can we recognize and resist 'priestcraft'—religious leadership that seeks praise or gain?",
    "How does the chapter’s universal invitation ('Come... without money and without price') shape our approach to sharing faith with people of different backgrounds?",
    "What practices cultivate the 'charity' (love) the text says is essential, and how would those practices change our treatment of the poor and marginalized?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Some prophetic details are ambiguous: the timing and identity of 'three generations... and many of the fourth,' the precise referent of 'my seed and the seed of my brethren' (specific Nephite/Lamanite groups or a broader lineage), and whether descriptions like God 'camped against them round about' should be read literally or as symbolic/visionary language. The passage about writings 'sealed up in a book' and their recipients is also open to differing interpretations about which records are meant.",

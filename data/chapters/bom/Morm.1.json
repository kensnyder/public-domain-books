  "chapterOsisID": "Morm.1",
  "briefOverview": "Mormon introduces himself as the recorder of his people, recounts his early commissioning to preserve the plates of Nephi, and summarizes a cycle of war, brief peace, and moral decline among the Nephites.",
  "summary": "Mormon describes being appointed in childhood to keep and later add to the plates of Nephi after Ammaron hid the sacred records. He is carried to Zarahemla with his father and observes a large, populous land and immediate warfare between Nephite and Lamanite factions. After initial Nephite victories there is a short period of peace lasting about four years, but wickedness then spreads widely: miracles and spiritual gifts cease, and the Holy Ghost no longer comes because of unbelief. Although Mormon experiences a personal spiritual visitation and \"tastes and knew of the goodness of Jesus,\" he is forbidden to preach because the people have willfully rebelled and their hearts are hardened. The land is cursed, treasures are hidden, and widespread corruption follows, including Gadianton robbers, sorceries, and fulfillment of earlier prophetic warnings (Abinadi and Samuel the Lamanite).",
  "externalContext": "The Book of Mormon presents itself as a compilation of records kept on metal plates by successive prophets and historians; Mormon is both a record-keeper and later a military leader who abridges earlier documents. The social background includes recurrent intertribal warfare between Nephite and Lamanite groups and internal threats from secret combinations (Gadianton robbers), which function as political and criminal conspiracies in the narrative. Literacy and engraving on plates reflect an ancient Near Eastern-style record culture that the text portrays within the Americas.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter explicitly cites fulfillment of prophecies by Abinadi (see Mosiah 17) and Samuel the Lamanite (see Helaman 13â€“16), both of whom warned of societal wickedness and coming judgments. The instruction to take up the \"plates of Nephi\" connects to the earlier Nephite record tradition begun in 1 Nephi, and Mormon's tasting of Jesus anticipates the later detailed account of Christ's ministry among the Nephites (see 3 Nephi 11).",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "How should communities preserve and transmit important moral and historical records today?",
    "What responsibilities do witnesses of spiritual truth have when a community resists or forbids preaching?",
    "How can societies recognize and guard against the rise of secretive, corrupt groups that undermine public trust?",
    "When spiritual gifts or communal moral consensus appear to wane, what practical steps can religious communities take to encourage repentance and renewal?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text leaves open exactly how Mormon \"tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus\" (vision, spiritual assurance, or other experience). The detailed nature and organization of the Gadianton robbers beyond being criminal conspirators is not fully explained here. Chronological precision (exact years and synchronisms with other events) is also uncertain from this chapter alone.",

  "chapterOsisID": "Omni.1",
  "briefOverview": "A short succession of record-keepers summarizes wars, migrations, and the preservation of sacred records, concluding with Amaleki's religious exhortation and the transfer of the plates.",
  "summary": "Omni and several successive record-keepers (Amaron, Chemish, Abinadom, Amaleki) give brief entries noting periods of peace and war, their duty to keep the plates, and transfers of custody. Amaleki recounts King Mosiah leading those who hearkened out of the land of Nephi and their discovery of the people of Zarahemla, who had come from Jerusalem at the time Zedekiah was carried into Babylon. Mosiah interprets engravings on a large stone by divine gift, learns the Zarahemla people's history, teaches them his language, and unites the two peoples under his kingship. Amaleki also narrates the discovery of Coriantumr, the survivor of another people, and reports on Nephite military successes under King Benjamin. Before dying without descendants, Amaleki gives the plates to Benjamin, urges all to come unto Christ and practice prayer, fasting, prophecy, and other spiritual gifts, and mentions a faction who sought the land of Nephi and disappeared into the wilderness.",
  "externalContext": "Within the Book of Mormon narrative, these events are placed several centuries after Lehi's departure from Jerusalem and identify the people of Zarahemla with a group that left Jerusalem when Zedekiah was taken into Babylon (traditionally dated to the late 7th/early 6th century BCE). The text reflects an ancient Near Eastern-style practice of keeping important records on metal plates and emphasizes lineage and legal custodianship. It also presumes a prophetic culture in which kings and interpreters receive divine revelations and the power to translate inscriptions.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter echoes accounts elsewhere in the Book of Mormon: the discovery of brass plates and concern for written records recall Nephi's obtaining the brass plates (1 Nephi 3–5). The lone survivor Coriantumr and his brief residence with the people of Zarahemla connects to the Jaredite record later told in the Book of Ether (see Ether, final chapters). The mention that Zarahemla's people left Jerusalem when Zedekiah was taken corresponds with the biblical account of Zedekiah's capture (2 Kings 24–25 / Jeremiah). Amaleki's exhortation to \"come unto Christ\" and to observe fasting, prayer, prophecy, and other gifts anticipates the fuller ethical and christological teachings developed later in Mosiah and in King Benjamin's address (Mosiah 2–5).",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "How should families and communities preserve and pass on important spiritual and moral teachings today, as these record-keepers did with the plates?",
    "In what ways can individuals confess and correct personal wrongdoing while continuing to serve their communities, as Omni does?",
    "What responsibilities do leaders have to teach and unify diverse groups, and how might we apply Mosiah's example of teaching language and history?",
    "How can the exhortation to \"come unto Christ\" be translated into concrete practices (prayer, fasting, service) in contemporary life?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Some identities and chronologies are summarized briefly (for example, the precise relation of the people of Zarahemla to other groups like the Mulekites and the detailed timing of events). The connection between Coriantumr here and the fuller Jaredite narrative is implied but relies on cross-book correlation. Exact archaeological or historical corroboration of plates-on-metals and transoceanic movements is beyond what the text itself supplies.",

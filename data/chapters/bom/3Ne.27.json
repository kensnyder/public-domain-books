  "chapterOsisID": "3Ne.27",
  "briefOverview": "Jesus instructs his disciples about the correct name of the church and defines the gospel—his mission, the need for baptism and endurance, and the basis of final judgment—closing with warnings about future apostasies and the narrow way to life.",
  "summary": "The disciples, gathered in prayer, ask Jesus what name the church should bear; Jesus answers that the church must be called by his name and built upon his gospel rather than on men. He summarizes the gospel: he was sent by the Father, was lifted up on the cross to draw all men, and by repentance, baptism in his name, reception of the Holy Ghost, and endurance to the end people are sanctified and can be held guiltless at judgment. Jesus warns that those not enduring are \"hewn down and cast into the fire,\" and that only those washed in his blood and faithful to the end enter his rest. He commands the people to write what they have seen and heard because records will be used to judge the people, appoints them as judges who must be like him, and promises that petitions made in his name will be granted. Jesus expresses great joy over the present generation (none of whom are lost) but laments that the fourth generation will fall away and be led by a \"son of perdition,\" and he concludes by exhorting them to enter by the strait gate and narrow way.",
  "externalContext": "Within Latter-day Saint tradition this chapter is part of Christ’s post-resurrection ministry to the Nephite peoples in the Americas (the account appears in the Book of Mormon). The emphasis on naming the church after Christ and on baptism \"in my name\" reflects theological priorities distinctive to that tradition but also echoes debates in early Christianity about authority and apostolic identity. Many themes here—atonement, repentance, baptism, sanctification by the Spirit, and the narrow way—draw on longstanding Jewish and Christian scriptural motifs.",
  "externalReferences": "The language about being \"lifted up\" and drawing all men closely parallels Jesus' words in John 12:32, where Jesus says that when he is lifted up he will draw all people. The teaching about the \"strait gate\" and the narrow way echoes Matthew 7:13–14. The command to be baptized in Jesus' name and the link between repentance, baptism, and reception of the Holy Spirit resemble formulations in Acts 2:38. The notion of a suffering servant who is wounded for transgressions resonates with Isaiah 53:3–5.",

    "How should a modern congregation reflect being \"called in Christ's name\" in its practices and identity?",
    "What concrete spiritual habits help a person 'endure to the end' in light of this chapter's requirements?",
    "How do we balance the chapter's emphasis on judgment according to works with teachings about grace and the atonement?",
    "What role do records, testimony, and storytelling play today in shaping communal and individual accountability before God?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Ambiguities include the precise identification and timing of the \"fourth generation\" and the referenced \"son of perdition,\" and how to reconcile the strong stress on judgment by works with doctrines of grace—textually the chapter affirms both Christ's atoning role and judgment according to works. The phrase that \"none of them are lost\" about the present generation is striking and raises questions about scope and criteria (physical survival, spiritual salvation, or temporary preservation).",

  "briefOverview": "Ammon reassures the queen that King Lamoni is not dead; Lamoni awakens, bears witness of the Redeemer, and an outpouring of the Spirit leads to conversions among the Lamanites.",
  "summary": "After Lamoni lies as if dead for two days, the queen summons Ammon, who declares the king is “sleeping in God” and will rise the next day. The queen believes, and Lamoni awakens, proclaiming that he has seen his Redeemer, who will be born and redeem all who believe; overwhelmed with joy, he, the queen, and Ammon collapse as the Spirit is poured out. The servants also call upon God and fall to the earth, except Abish, a long-converted Lamanite woman who runs to gather the people. A crowd assembles, debates Ammon’s identity and power, and one attacker drops dead when attempting to kill Ammon. Abish takes the queen by the hand; the queen arises, praises Jesus, and raises Lamoni, who rebukes the contention and teaches the people; many believe, while others leave. Ammon, Lamoni, and the servants testify their hearts are changed, many report angelic visitations, numerous people are baptized, a church is established, and the narrative concludes that God’s arm is extended to all who repent and believe.",
  "externalContext": "This episode occurs during the missions of the sons of Mosiah among the Lamanites, a people traditionally hostile to the Nephites. In the surrounding narrative, Ammon had become Lamoni’s servant and won great favor by defending the king’s flocks at the waters of Sebus. Lamanite religious language often refers to deity as the “Great Spirit,” shaping how the crowd interprets Ammon’s power. In ancient Near Eastern and Mesoamerican contexts, burials could occur quickly after apparent death, adding urgency to the queen’s inquiry.",
  "externalReferences": "Lamoni’s testimony that the Redeemer will be born and redeem believers echoes King Benjamin’s prophecy that the Lord would come down, be called Jesus Christ, and atone for the sins of the world (Mosiah 3:5–11). The people’s report that they have “no more desire to do evil” parallels the change of heart after Benjamin’s sermon (Mosiah 5:2). Angelic visitations and being overpowered by the Spirit recall the conversion of Alma the Younger (Mosiah 27:11–17; Alma 36:5–24). The mention of Ammon’s earlier defense of the flocks and the related animosity references the incident at the waters of Sebus (Alma 17:26–39); the concluding affirmation that God’s arm is extended to all who repent resonates with Nephite teachings about God’s outstretched arm to all peoples (2 Nephi 28:32).",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "Where do I see opportunities, like Abish, to quietly but courageously invite others to witness God’s work?",
    "How does prior trust in God’s word prepare me to act before I have all the evidence, as the queen did?",
    "When spiritual experiences are misunderstood or opposed, how can I respond without contention?",
    "What would it mean in my life to have “no more desire to do evil,” and what practices foster such a change of heart?",
    "How can I extend God’s invitation of repentance and belief to people outside my usual circle?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text does not explain the precise cause of the attacker’s sudden death or the physiological nature of being “overpowered” by the Spirit. The phrase “a remarkable vision of her father” that converted Abish is ambiguous (whether it was a vision received by her father or of her father). Details of how baptisms and church organization were administered in this setting are summarized without specifics.",

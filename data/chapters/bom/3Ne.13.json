  "chapterOsisID": "3Ne.13",
  "briefOverview": "Christ teaches private, sincere devotion and warns against ostentation, materialism, and anxious planning; he gives the Lord's Prayer and urges trust in God's provision.",
  "summary": "Jesus instructs his listeners to give alms, pray, and fast in secret rather than to perform these acts for public praise, promising that the Father who sees in secret will reward them. He warns against vain repetitions in prayer and provides a model prayer (the Lord's Prayer) that emphasizes God's holiness, kingdom, daily provision, forgiveness, and deliverance from evil. Jesus links forgiveness of others to receiving forgiveness from the Father. He exhorts disciples not to store up earthly treasures but to value heavenly treasures, teaching that where one's treasure is, the heart will be also, and that a 'single' or healthy eye fills the whole body with light. He declares that one cannot serve both God and Mammon. Finally, he counsels against anxious worry about food, drink, and clothing, pointing to God's care for birds and lilies and urging his listeners to seek first God's kingdom and righteousness, with assurance that necessary things will be provided.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter is the Nephite account of Jesus repeating teachings similar to the Sermon on the Mount; its language and themes closely parallel Matthew 6 (and portions of Luke). The instructions reflect Mediterranean and Jewish religious forms of the first century (public almsgiving, synagogue prayer, ritual fasting) where honor and reputation were socially important, which helps explain the emphasis on secrecy and inward devotion. The economic insecurity of many in antiquity also makes the teaching against anxious worrying about provisions especially resonant.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter corresponds closely to Matthew 6:1–34 (almsgiving, prayer, the Lord's Prayer, fasting, treasures, 'single eye,' 'no man can serve two masters,' and do not be anxious). The Lord's Prayer here matches elements found also in Luke 11:2–4. The instruction about serving God and Mammon parallels Matthew 6:24.",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "How can I give or serve without seeking recognition (e.g., on social media or in my community)?",
    "In what ways can I make my prayer life more private and sincere rather than performative?",
    "How do I balance responsible planning (work, budgeting) with the teaching to 'take no thought' for daily needs?",
    "What practical steps can I take to 'seek first the kingdom' when making financial or career decisions?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The precise meaning of 'single eye' (whether moral simplicity, generosity, or undivided focus) admits multiple readings; the command to 'take no thought' must be balanced with normal responsibilities, and the text does not specify how to reconcile long-term planning with this injunction. Also, the reference to synagogues and 'hypocrites' reflects Jewish practices familiar to Matthew but its direct cultural fit in the Nephite setting is assumed rather than detailed in the chapter.",

  "chapterOsisID": "3Ne.23",
  "briefOverview": "Jesus exhorts the people to study Isaiah and to preserve prophetic records, specifically commanding that Samuel the Lamanite’s fulfilled prophecy be written and taught.",
  "summary": "Jesus commands the people to search the writings of Isaiah diligently and to write and preserve the scriptures he has expounded to them. He emphasizes that Isaiah spoke concerning the house of Israel and also to the Gentiles, and that his words have unfolded according to prophecy. Jesus then directs Nephi to bring his record; on examining it he notes that Samuel the Lamanite’s prophecy about many saints rising and ministering had been fulfilled but not written. Jesus commands that this event be recorded, and finally instructs that the scriptures he expounded should be taught to others.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter appears in the Book of Mormon account of Jesus’s post-resurrection visit to the peoples in the Americas (3 Nephi). Nephi and other record-keepers maintained written annals, and prophets like Samuel the Lamanite earlier preached among the Nephites (see Helaman in the Book of Mormon). Study of Isaiah is a recurring emphasis in Second Temple Judaism and in prophetic traditions preserved by the Nephite community.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter explicitly references Samuel the Lamanite’s prophecy about many saints rising; that prophecy is recorded earlier in the Book of Mormon (see Helaman 14 for Samuel’s preaching and predictions about signs and the rising of many saints). The insistence that Jesus ‘expounded all the scriptures’ and that people should ‘search the prophets’ resonates with New Testament scenes where the risen Jesus interprets scripture to his followers (e.g., Luke 24:27, 24:44).",

  "uncertainAreas": "Exact Old Testament (Isaiah) passages intended by the text are not specified here; also the chapter alludes to Samuel the Lamanite’s prophecy without quoting it, so the reader must consult Helaman for details.",

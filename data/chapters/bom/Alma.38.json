  "chapterOsisID": "Alma.38",
  "briefOverview": "A fatherly exhortation from Alma to his son Shiblon emphasizing continued faithfulness, humility in prayer, and reliance on Christ for salvation.",
  "summary": "Alma commends Shiblon for his steady faith and urges him to continue keeping God's commandments so he will prosper and not be cut off from God's presence. He reminds Shiblon of Shiblon's past sufferings among the Zoramites and recounts that deliverance comes when one trusts God. Alma testifies that his knowledge comes from the Spirit and recounts his own angelic visitation and three days of anguish before he cried to Jesus Christ and received forgiveness. He declares that salvation is found only in and through Christ, calling Jesus the life and light of the world. Alma then gives practical instructions: teach diligently, be temperate, avoid pride, bridle passions, cultivate love, work industriously, and pray with humility rather than to be seen by others. He closes with a blessing and sends Shiblon to teach the people.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter is part of the Book of Mormon's narrative of the Nephite prophet-leaders and their missionary efforts; Alma is speaking as a seasoned religious authority to his sons during a period of internal religious conflict (the Zoramites are a separatist, prideful group in the narrative). Public displays of prayer and rhetorical self-commendation are portrayed negatively here, reflecting broader ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean concerns about ostentation in worship. Visionary experiences and angelic visitations are recurrent motifs in this literature and are used to authenticate prophetic authority.",
  "externalReferences": "Alma's reference to being in 'bonds' and suffering, and to an angelic visitation and three days and nights of agony, picks up themes recounted in Alma 36, where Alma narrates his conversion experience. The emphasis that 'there is no other way' but Christ resonates with New Testament statements about Jesus as the exclusive source of salvation (cf. John 14:6) and the image of Jesus as 'the light of the world' (cf. John 8:12). The warning against praying to be seen of men is thematically similar to the teaching in Luke 18:9â€“14 (the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector) about humility in prayer.",

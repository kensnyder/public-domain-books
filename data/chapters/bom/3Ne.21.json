  "chapterOsisID": "3Ne.21",
  "briefOverview": "Jesus promises a sign and describes the future gathering of Israel through the Gentiles, with warnings for the unrepentant and promises for those who join the covenant.",
  "summary": "Jesus tells the people that a sign will mark the time when the Father will begin to gather Israel from its long dispersion and establish Zion. He explains that the work will come forth from the Gentiles—who, if they repent, will bring knowledge of these things to a remnant of Israel—and that this is according to the Father's wisdom. The chapter warns that Gentiles who do not repent will be cut off and face judgment, while those who repent will assist the remnant of Jacob in building the New Jerusalem. It concludes with promises that heavenly power and the Father's guidance will accompany the gathering of the dispersed tribes to their inheritance.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter is from 3 Nephi in the Book of Mormon, a text published in 1830 and regarded in Latter‑day Saint tradition as an ancient record of peoples in the Americas. Within the narrative it occurs after Jesus' resurrection and his ministry to the Nephites, addressing the future role of Gentile nations and the eventual regathering of Israel. The terms 'Gentiles,' 'remnant of Jacob,' and 'New Jerusalem' are used with covenantal and apocalyptic meaning common to Second Temple and early Christian‑style prophetic language.",
  "externalReferences": "The theme of God regathering Israel echoes Hebrew Bible prophecies such as Isaiah 11:11–12 and Ezekiel 37:21–22, which speak of gathering the scattered house of Israel. The promise of a restored holy city called the New Jerusalem finds a parallel in Revelation 21:1–3, where a renewed Jerusalem is central to end‑time hope. Deuteronomy 30:3 similarly envisions God restoring exiles to their land, a motif reflected in this chapter's promise of bringing the dispersed to their inheritance.",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "How should modern readers interpret the term 'Gentiles' in their own cultural and historical context?",
    "What practical steps can faith communities take to 'assist' those they consider part of a covenant people?",
    "In what ways do warnings about idolatry, priestcraft, and deceit apply to contemporary religious and civic life?",
    "How might the promise of a gathered community shape priorities for missionary work, charity, and reconciliation?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The chapter's reference 'it shall be done even as Moses said' is not explicitly tied to a single clear Old Testament verse within the chapter, so the precise Moses passage intended is uncertain. The identification of 'Gentiles' and how broadly the promise of gathering applies (which contemporary peoples are meant) can be read in different ways and depends on theological interpretation.",

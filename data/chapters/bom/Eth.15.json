  "chapterOsisID": "Eth.15",
  "briefOverview": "A closing account of the final, devastating battles of the Jaredite people and the prophet Ether’s final witness and record-keeping.",
  "summary": "Coriantumr, wounded and mourning over the slaughter of nearly two million people, attempts to avert further bloodshed by offering his crown to Shiz, who answers that he will spare the people only if Coriantumr surrenders himself to be killed. The two sides continue a prolonged, horrific civil war—gathering all survivors, fighting for days and nights, lamenting over the slain, and gradually cutting each other down until only a few remain. After successive engagements in which both armies suffer grievous losses, the final combat leaves only Coriantumr and Shiz alive; Coriantumr beheads Shiz, who then dies, and Coriantumr himself collapses seemingly dead. The Lord affirms to Ether that the prophecies have been fulfilled; Ether finishes his record, hides most of it, and states his willingness either to be translated or to suffer in the flesh so long as he is saved in God’s kingdom.",
  "externalContext": "The chapter belongs to the closing material of a long narrative about the Jaredite civilization, traditionally presented as a pre-Columbian American people whose end comes through internecine warfare. In the Book of Mormon tradition, prophetic record-keeping (plates and hidden records) is a major cultural and religious feature, and the theme of a prophet witnessing a civilization’s destruction recalls ancient Near Eastern and biblical lament motifs. The idea of being ‘translated’ (taken by God without dying) appears elsewhere in Latter-day Saint writings and folklore as a possible divine outcome for certain righteous individuals.",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "When leaders offer to give up power to spare lives (v.4–5), how should communities weigh surrender versus resistance in order to prevent mass suffering?",
    "What responsibilities do survivors and witnesses (like Ether) have to preserve and pass on records of collective failures and tragedies?",
    "How should communities interpret the idea that a divine Spirit 'ceased striving' with a people (v.19) when considering moral responsibility and social reform?",
    "In what ways can lament and communal mourning (v.16–17) contribute to healing after large-scale violence?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Identification of 'hill Ramah' with later Book of Mormon locations and precise cross-references to where Limhi’s finding of the plates is narrated; also the exact meaning of 'translated' in verse 34 (whether bodily translation or poetic expression of divine deliverance) is open to interpretation.",

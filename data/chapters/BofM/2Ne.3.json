  "briefOverview": "Lehi blesses his youngest son Joseph, recounting ancient prophecies attributed to Joseph of Egypt about a future seer and the uniting of sacred records to restore Israel.",
  "summary": "Lehi blesses Joseph with the promised land and assures him that his seed will not be destroyed if they keep the commandments. He identifies himself as a descendant of Joseph of Egypt and quotes prophecies that a “choice seer,” like Moses, would arise from Joseph’s lineage to bring forth God’s word and help Joseph’s descendants remember the covenants. This seer would be named after Joseph and after his father, would be commanded to do only God’s work, and would be made strong despite weakness. Lehi declares that the writings of Joseph’s descendants and those of Judah will “grow together” to confound false doctrine, end contention, and restore knowledge of the covenants in the latter days. He parallels the coming seer with Moses, including the provision of a spokesman, and foretells that the words of Joseph’s people will “cry from the dust” to call their brethren to repentance. Lehi concludes that one mighty will arise to do much good and urges young Joseph to heed Nephi and remember his father’s words.",
  "externalContext": "This speech occurs near the end of Lehi’s life, after his family’s migration from Jerusalem (c. late 7th–early 6th century BCE) and settlement in a “promised land,” reflecting the practice of patriarchal blessings pronounced upon children. In ancient Israel, a “seer” was an accepted term for a prophetic figure (cf. 1 Samuel 9:9). References to Moses receiving the law “by the finger of God” evoke the Sinai covenant and a literate, covenant-keeping culture centered on written law. The expectation of Israel’s eventual restoration was common among exilic and post-exilic communities.",
  "externalReferences": "Lehi’s description of Moses as not “mighty in speaking” and having a spokesman reflects Exodus 4:10–16, where Aaron speaks for Moses. The statement that God would write His law “by the finger” parallels Exodus 31:18 and Deuteronomy 9:10. The image of a record that will “cry from the dust” resonates with Isaiah 29:4. The prophecy that the writings of Joseph and Judah will “grow together” echoes Ezekiel 37:15–20; the attribution of detailed prophecies to Joseph of Egypt parallels material found in the Joseph Smith Translation of Genesis 50:24–38.",

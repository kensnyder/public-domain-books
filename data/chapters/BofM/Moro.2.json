  "chapterOsisID": "Moro.2",
  "briefOverview": "Christ instructs the twelve apostles about invoking the Father in his name and conferring the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.",
  "summary": "Moroni records a brief teaching of Christ given to the twelve apostles as he laid his hands on them. He tells them to call on the Father in his name in ‘mighty prayer,’ after which they will have the power to give the Holy Ghost by laying on hands. This authority is to be exercised in Christ’s name and is presented as the practice of his apostles. The chapter emphasizes that these words were spoken at Christ’s first appearing; the larger multitude did not hear, but the disciples did, and when they laid hands on people the Holy Ghost fell upon them.",
  "externalContext": "This passage comes from the Book of Mormon’s later books (Moroni) and refers back to Jesus’ post-resurrection ministry among the Nephite peoples as narrated elsewhere in the Book of Mormon (3 Nephi). The practice of conferring the Holy Spirit by laying on of hands has parallels in early Christian ritual and in Second Temple Jewish laying-on-of-hands traditions used for blessing, commissioning, or transfer of status.",
  "externalReferences": "The New Testament contains similar scenes: John 20:22 describes Jesus breathing on his disciples and saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit,' while Acts 8:14–17 reports the apostles laying hands on Samaritans so they received the Holy Spirit. Matthew 28:18–20 and Acts 1:8 frame apostolic authority and the promise of power associated with the Spirit, which provide a broader biblical context for the authority to baptize and commission in Jesus’ name.",

    "How does my faith community interpret and practice the laying on of hands today?",
    "What does it mean to 'call on the Father in my name' when praying—how does that shape Christian prayer life?",
    "How should communities recognize and authenticate authority to minister spiritual gifts?",
    "In what ways can the idea of 'mighty prayer' inform personal and communal prayer practices?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The short passage leaves ambiguous what precisely is meant by 'mighty prayer' and how that phrase differs from ordinary prayer. It is also concise about the scope and limits of the authority conferred (who may receive it, whether it is repeatable, and the precise mechanics), and those details rely on broader Book of Mormon narrative and later interpretive traditions.",

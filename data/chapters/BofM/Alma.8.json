  "chapterOsisID": "Alma.8",
  "briefOverview": "Alma continues his missionary labors, faces rejection in Ammonihah, receives an angelic commission to return, and gains a faithful companion, Amulek, with whom he begins to preach and exercise miraculous power.",
  "summary": "Alma finishes earlier ministerial work and travels through Melek, baptizing many, then comes to the city of Ammonihah where the people reject and cast him out. While distressed, an angel appears, commends his faithfulness, and commands him to return and warn the city of impending divine judgment. Alma obeys, enters Ammonihah by a different route, and is given hospitality by Amulek, whom he calls to the ministry after explaining his mission. Alma and Amulek preach together, are filled with the Spirit, and are granted powers that will later be shown when they are bound and imprisoned as part of the Lord's plan to manifest His power.",
  "externalContext": "The narrative takes place during the Nephite 'reign of the judges,' a period of internal political-religious organization following the end of kingship in the Book of Mormon. City-naming after first possessors reflects a common ancient naming practice recorded in the text; itinerant prophets and baptismal converts are typical features of the Book of Mormon's missionary culture. Angelic visitations and direct divine commissions to prophets are recurring motifs in this tradition.",
  "externalReferences": "Alma's earlier role in organizing the church and his establishment of church order is described elsewhere in the text (see Alma 4). Alma's own dramatic conversion and earlier angelic call are narrated in Mosiah 27:11–26, providing a parallel to the angelic encouragement he receives here. The later consequences of Alma and Amulek's ministry in Ammonihah—imprisonment and violent opposition, including the burning of believers—are recorded in Alma 14:3–18.",

    "How should we respond when efforts to share our beliefs are rejected or met with hostility?",
    "In what ways can hospitality (like Amulek's) enable and strengthen religious service today?",
    "When discouraged by apparent failure, how do we discern whether to persist, change approach, or trust in divine timing?",
    "How can communities recognize and resist collective hardening of heart when confronted with moral warning?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Exact historical-geographical details (e.g., precise locations of Melek or Ammonihah) are internal to the Book of Mormon narrative and not independently verifiable here. The chapter implies but does not narrate why Amulek recognized Alma from an angelic vision; whether Amulek had personally seen that vision or had been told about it is not fully explicit. The nature and limits of the 'power' given to Alma and Amulek are described only briefly here and are developed more in later chapters.",

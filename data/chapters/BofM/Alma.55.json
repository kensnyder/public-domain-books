  "briefOverview": "A tactical episode in which Moroni rescues Nephite prisoners by ruse while intentionally limiting bloodshed, followed by prudential measures against Lamanite trickery and preparations for further offensives.",
  "summary": "Moroni refuses Ammoron’s proposal to exchange prisoners unless Ammoron abandons his cause, then plans a rescue. He finds a man named Laman — a Lamanite descendant — who infiltrates the Lamanite guards at the city of Gid by claiming to be an escaped Lamanite with wine. The Lamanites become drunk and fall asleep; Moroni silently arms the Nephite prisoners inside the walls and surrounds the city at night, so that in the morning the Lamanites discover they are trapped and surrender. Moroni frees the Nephite prisoners, enlists them, and uses captured Lamanites to rebuild and strengthen fortifications. The Nephites regain the initiative, guard against attempts to intoxicate or poison them by testing wine on prisoners first, and Moroni begins preparing to attack the fortified city Morianton as the twenty-ninth year of the judges closes.",
  "externalContext": "Within the Book of Mormon narrative, Moroni is the Nephite military leader conducting a long campaign against Lamanite forces and their dissident Nephite allies. Siege warfare, night raids, deception, and fortifications are recurring military features in ancient and pre-modern conflicts; using intoxication or poisoning as a tactic is attested in many historical contexts, which helps explain the Nephites' caution. Concerns about the ethical conduct of war (limiting needless bloodshed, protecting noncombatants) are prominent in this text and reflect leadership values stressed elsewhere in the narrative.",

  "uncertainAreas": "Exact cross-references to other Alma chapters/events were not provided here, so I avoided citing specific chapter-and-verse links. The phrase 'I will seek death among them' and some motivations (e.g., why Moroni chose this particular ruse vs. others) allow multiple interpretations about Moroni’s intent and risk assessment.",

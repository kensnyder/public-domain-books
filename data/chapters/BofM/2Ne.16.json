  "chapterOsisID": "2Ne.16",
  "briefOverview": "A prophetic vision of God's majestic holiness leads to the prophet's cleansing and commissioning to proclaim judgment, with a final note of a surviving remnant.",
  "summary": "The narrator sees the Lord enthroned in the year King Uzziah died, attended by seraphim who cry \"Holy, holy, holy,\" filling the temple with smoke. Overwhelmed by God's holiness, the speaker confesses his own unclean lips and that of his people. A seraph touches the prophet's lips with a live coal from the altar, declaring his sin purged. God asks whom He should send; the prophet volunteers and is commissioned to speak to a people who will hear yet not understand, becoming increasingly hardened until cities are laid waste. The chapter closes with the promise that a tenth—a holy remnant—will remain and be like a tree's substance that returns after shedding leaves.",
  "externalContext": "The scene echoes an 8th-century BCE Judahite setting: \"in the year that King Uzziah died\" places the vision in the late monarchic period when Isaiah is traditionally active. Temple imagery (altar, smoke, seraphim) draws on Israelite cultic language; tongs and live coal recall sacrificial rites. The motif of a prophet being purified and then commissioned is common in the Hebrew prophetic tradition.",
  "externalReferences": "This chapter corresponds closely to Isaiah 6:1–13 in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament (same vision and commission). The triple \"Holy, holy, holy\" formula also appears in Revelation 4:8 as a worship refrain before God's throne. The theme of a preserved remnant resonates with New Testament reflections on election and remnant, for example Romans 11:5, which speaks of a faithful remnant preserved by grace.",

  "practicalQuestions": [
    "How does an awareness of divine holiness affect how I assess my own failings and need for cleansing?",
    "In what ways might confession and symbolic acts of cleansing prepare someone for service or mission today?",
    "How should communities balance warnings of judgment with the hope offered by a preserved remnant?",
    "What does it mean to answer God's call in a situation where people seem unwilling or unable to receive the message?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Ambiguity remains about the precise meaning of the \"tenth\" (whether literal proportion or symbolic remnant) and the exact nature of the seraphim imagery (literal cherubic beings vs. symbolic attendants). Also uncertain are the immediate historical referents of the cities and the timeline of the predicted desolation in this text's prophetic frame.",

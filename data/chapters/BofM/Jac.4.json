  "chapterOsisID": "Jac.4",
  "briefOverview": "Jacob explains why he engraves a limited record, testifies of Christ and the atonement, and warns against rejecting plain prophetic truth in favor of hidden things.",
  "summary": "Jacob begins by explaining the practical limits of engraving on plates and his hope that these preserved words will teach future generations. He testifies that he and earlier prophets knew and hoped in Christ long before the incarnation, and that the law of Moses served as a type pointing to Him (using Abraham's offering of Isaac as an example). Jacob affirms that scripture, revelation, and the Spirit produce an unshaken faith that can even manifest power, while also emphasizing human weakness and dependence on God's grace. He exhorts readers not to 'counsel the Lord' but to accept His wise and merciful governance, and to be reconciled through Christ’s atonement and the resurrection. Finally, Jacob condemns those who seek obscure teachings and reject plain truth, pronouncing that the Jews will stumble by rejecting the 'stone' that becomes the sure foundation, and promises to unfold this mystery further.",
  "externalContext": "In Book of Mormon tradition Jacob is presented as a Nephite prophet and brother of Nephi; the record-keepers are said to have engraved important teachings on metal plates to ensure durability. The rhetorical emphasis on typology (Isaac as a 'similitude') follows a long interpretive practice in Jewish and early Christian readings that see events in the Hebrew scriptures as foreshadowing the Messiah. The image of a rejected 'stone' later becoming a cornerstone has a well-established resonance in Israelite scripture and Second Temple interpretive traditions.",
  "externalReferences": "Jacob explicitly alludes to the near-sacrifice of Isaac (Genesis 22:1-19) as a type of the Father offering His Only Begotten Son. His statement that creation came by the power of God's word echoes passages like Genesis 1 and Psalm 33:6. The image of the rejected stone becoming the foundation parallels Isaiah 28:16 and Psalm 118:22 and is later quoted and applied to Christ in the New Testament (e.g., Matthew 21:42; 1 Peter 2:6-8).",

  "chapterOsisID": "Hel.16",
  "briefOverview": "Samuel the Lamanite's preaching produces both genuine conversions and intensified unbelief; the chapter summarizes several years of increasing wickedness despite signs and miracles.",
  "summary": "Many who hear Samuel the Lamanite on the city wall believe, seek out Nephi, confess, and are baptized, while others attempt to stone and shoot Samuel but cannot hit him because the Spirit protects him. After failing to capture him, the hostile crowd accuses him of having a devil; Samuel ultimately leaps from the wall and returns to his own land to prophesy there, and is not heard from again. The narrative then summarizes several years of the reign of the judges, noting a general hardening and increasing wickedness among most people, though a smaller group lives more righteously. In the ninetieth year, great signs and wonders begin to occur—angels appear and prophecies begin to be fulfilled—but many still harden their hearts, offering skeptical objections about Christ and accusing prophetic tradition of being a cunning deception. Satan is portrayed as actively stirring up contention and unbelief across the land, and the book of Helaman concludes with this sober assessment of the people's condition.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter is part of the Book of Mormon narrative, which presents itself as an ancient record of peoples called Nephites and Lamanites living in the Americas during a period labeled the 'reign of the judges.' The episode of a prophet speaking from a city wall (Samuel) is a dramatic prophetic gesture that resembles other prophetic spectacles in ancient literature, where public performance underscores urgency and public accountability. The Book of Mormon was first published in 1830, and its internal chronology organizes events by regnal years and prophetic cycles.",
  "externalReferences": "Samuel the Lamanite's extended prophecy and his earlier preaching appear in Helaman 13–15, which set the immediate context for the conversions and attacks described here. The 'signs and wonders' and the expectation that 'the Christ must shortly come' are realized later in the Book of Mormon narrative in 3 Nephi, which records the signs of Christ's birth (see 3 Nephi 1) and Christ's post-resurrection visit to the people (see 3 Nephi 11).",

    "When prophetic warnings or moral critiques make people uncomfortable, how should communities balance skepticism with openness to repentance?",
    "What practical steps can communities take to support those who turn from wrongdoing and seek spiritual renewal?",

  "uncertainAreas": "The text does not specify details about where Samuel goes ('his own country') or what ultimately becomes of him, and the narrative compresses several years into summary form, leaving gaps about the precise sequence and social dynamics behind the spread of unbelief and the nature of the 'wise men' to whom angels appeared.",

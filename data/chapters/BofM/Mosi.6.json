  "chapterOsisID": "Mosi.6",
  "briefOverview": "King Benjamin completes a covenant renewal, consecrates his son Mosiah as king, and records the beginning of Mosiah's peaceful, righteous reign.",
  "summary": "Benjamin ensures that all who were able had entered into a covenant to keep God's commandments and takes their names; only little children are excepted. After finishing his address, Benjamin consecrates his son Mosiah as ruler, appoints priests to instruct the people, and dismisses the assembly to their homes. Mosiah begins to reign at age thirty (about 476 years since Lehi left Jerusalem). King Benjamin lives three more years and then dies. The chapter emphasizes that Mosiah walked in the ways of the Lord, worked the land himself so as not to burden his people, encouraged them to till the ground, and that there was no contention among the people for three years.",
  "externalContext": "Within the Book of Mormon narrative, covenant-making and taking a leader's name (here, 'the name of Christ') are central communal religious acts described earlier in Benjamin's address. The text reflects an agrarian society where kingship and priestly instruction are linked to communal stability; a ruler who models labor and piety would be seen as legitimizing his authority. The chapter also sits in a larger chronicle that counts years from Lehi's departure from Jerusalem, a foundational event for Nephite chronology.",
  "externalReferences": "This chapter follows King Benjamin's major sermon and covenant scene recorded in Mosiah 2–5, and specifically echoes the declaration that the people had taken upon them the name of Christ (see Mosiah 5:5–8). The reference to the number of years since Lehi left Jerusalem ties this short record into the broader Book of Mormon chronology that begins with the narrative in 1 Nephi.",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text gives little detail about the practical meaning of 'taking upon them the name of Christ' (ritual forms, legal/communal effects). The chronology ('about 476 years') is stated without explanation of the reckoning method. The phrase 'not one soul, except it were little children' could be read strictly or as rhetorical emphasis; the exact exceptions and criteria for covenant participation are not specified.",

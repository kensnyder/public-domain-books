  "chapterOsisID": "2Ne.29",
  "briefOverview": "The chapter defends ongoing revelation and rejects the claim that the Bible is the sole, complete scripture. It asserts that God speaks to many nations and that multiple written records will be gathered as testimony of God’s covenant people.",
  "summary": "The Lord announces a renewed effort to recover and remember his covenant people and to cause words to proceed to the ends of the earth (vv. 1–2). He rebukes Gentiles who claim the Bible is sufficient and questions their ingratitude toward the Jews who preserved scripture (vv. 3–6). God declares that he speaks to many nations, including those on the isles of the sea, and that multiple nations writing scripture will provide mutual testimony (vv. 7–12). The chapter teaches that additional books will be written and used in God’s judgment, that different records will be shared among Jews, Nephites, and the lost tribes, and that Israel will be gathered and the word will be united (vv. 13–14).",
  "externalContext": "This chapter appears in the Book of Mormon, published in 1830 and presented by its translators and adherents as ancient Israelite writings rendered into English. In its nineteenth-century North American setting, the text addresses contemporaneous Christian objections to new scripture and articulates a theological claim for continuing revelation. The chapter reflects themes important to the movement that produced the Book of Mormon: restoration, the gathering of Israel, and the legitimacy of additional written records alongside the Bible.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter’s emphasis on God’s covenant with Abraham echoes Genesis passages that promise blessing and remembrance of Abraham’s seed (see Genesis 12:3; Genesis 17:7). The notion that the testimony of two nations is a witness resonates with the Old Testament legal principle requiring multiple witnesses (cf. Deuteronomy 19:15). The phrase about God being the same \"yesterday, today, and forever\" parallels wording found in Hebrews 13:8, which affirms divine constancy while allowing for ongoing speech or action.",

  "uncertainAreas": "Uncertainty exists about historical authorship and intended original audience (ancient Nephi vs. nineteenth-century translator/author). The precise identification of \"the isles of the sea\" and the full identity of the \"other tribes\" are not defined within the chapter and admit multiple interpretations.",

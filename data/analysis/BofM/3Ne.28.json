  "chapterOsisID": "3Ne.28",
  "briefOverview": "Jesus grants three of his disciples a unique, ongoing ministry and immortality (they 'tarry'), describes their miraculous protection and future mission, and Mormon explains that their bodies were changed so they would not taste death.",
  "summary": "Jesus asks each disciple what they desire; most ask to finish their ministry and come quickly to his kingdom, receiving a promise of rest at age seventy-two. Three disciples request something different (following John’s example) and are told they will not taste death but will 'tarry' to behold all the Father's works and be changed at Christ's coming. Jesus touches the chosen disciples, they are caught up and see unspeakable things but are commanded not to speak of them, and afterward they continue to minister among the people performing extraordinary miracles and surviving lethal trials. Mormon reports that he was forbidden to write the names of those who would not taste death, notes their ministry among Gentiles and Jews, and emphasizes the great works they will perform before the final judgment. He clarifies later that a change was wrought on their bodies (distinct from the final resurrection) so Satan could not tempt them and they would be sanctified in the flesh until the day of judgment.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter is part of the Book of Mormon narrative in which the resurrected Jesus visits the peoples of the ancient Americas (Book of Mormon tradition places these events after Christ's resurrection). The idea of individuals 'not tasting death' or being translated into God's presence without dying echoes Jewish and biblical traditions about Enoch and Elijah, which early Christian readers would recognize. The text reflects concerns about prophetic authority, special divine commission, and the role of miraculous witnesses in calling people to repentance.",
  "externalReferences": "The motif of persons taken by God without experiencing death parallels accounts of Elijah being taken up (2 Kings 2:11) and Enoch being 'taken' (Genesis 5:24; Hebrews 11:5). The transfiguration-like vision and restriction on speaking of it recall Gospel scenes such as the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1–9). The statement that the Father and Son are one echoes Johannine language of unity (John 10:30), and the promise that some 'shall never taste of death' has a rough parallel in Jesus' saying about those who keep his words not 'seeing death' (John 8:51).",

  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Uncertainty about precise identity of the three 'tarrying' disciples (beyond their association with John) and the exact nature of the 'change'—how it differs from final resurrection—rely on the text's limited explanation. The reason God forbade Mormon from recording the names is not explained, leaving interpretive questions about divine secrecy and its purpose. The timing and scope of their ministry 'among the Gentiles and Jews' could be read futurally or as ongoing, which the chapter does not fully specify.",

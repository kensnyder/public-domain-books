  "chapterOsisID": "Moro.1",
  "briefOverview": "Moroni explains why he continues to write after finishing the Jaredite record and describes intense persecution of faithful Nephites by the Lamanites.",
  "summary": "Moroni states that after completing his abridgment of the Jaredite (people of Jared) account he had intended to stop writing, but because he is still alive he records a few more things. He conceals himself from the Lamanites for safety because internecine wars are fierce and the Lamanites are killing any Nephite who will not deny Christ. Moroni affirms his refusal to deny Christ and explains that he wanders to preserve his life. He writes briefly with the hope that his words may benefit the Lamanites in some future day, according to the Lord's will.",
  "externalContext": "Within the Book of Mormon tradition, Moroni is understood as the last Nephite record-keeper who finishes the historical abridgment produced by his father, Mormon, and appends the Jaredite record (the Book of Ether). The long-standing Nephiteâ€“Lamanite conflict and concern for preserving sacred records are recurring features in this final period of the narrative. The short chapter functions as a personal preface and explanation of motive for continued writing amid collapse and persecution.",
  "externalReferences": "Moroni's mention of the \"account of the people of Jared\" refers to the Jaredite narrative recorded in Ether (the Book of Ether). His situation and the collapse of Nephite society and record-keeping are treated elsewhere in the closing books of Mormon, where the final battles and laments over destruction are narrated. Moroni's stated hope that his writings benefit future Lamanite readers anticipates his exhortations and appeals to later readers found in his subsequent chapters.",

    "How should we preserve important testimonies and documents when communities face threat or collapse?",
    "What does it look like to remain faithful to convictions when doing so risks personal safety?",
    "How can writings intended for 'future' readers shape the way we communicate values today?",
    "When is it appropriate to hide or refrain from making oneself known for safety, and how does that balance with public witness?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "Precise historical details (dates, locations) and the full scope of the persecutions are not provided in the short chapter. The text does not specify exactly how Moroni hid himself or the chronology between his abridgment and these events, leaving some narrative gaps about sequence and scale.",

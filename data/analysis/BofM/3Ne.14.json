  "chapterOsisID": "3Ne.14",
  "briefOverview": "Jesus teaches ethical guidance for interpersonal conduct, discernment of true and false teachers, and the importance of obedience as the basis for lasting life.",
  "summary": "This chapter contains a sequence of teachings: a warning against hypocritical judgment and the image of the mote and the beam (1–5); an admonition not to give what is holy to dogs or cast pearls before swine (6); a promise that persistent asking, seeking, and knocking will be answered and an appeal to God's parental care (7–11); the Golden Rule as the summary of the law and the prophets (12); a contrast between the wide road leading to destruction and the narrow way leading to life (13–14); a warning to beware of false prophets and to recognize them by their fruits (15–20); a caution that profession alone (“Lord, Lord”) without doing the Father’s will will be rejected (21–23); and a final parable contrasting the wise builder who hears and does Jesus’ sayings with the foolish builder who does not (24–27).",
  "externalContext": "3 Nephi is a book in the Book of Mormon presenting a post-resurrection ministry of Jesus to peoples in the Americas; many of its chapters closely parallel material in the New Testament Sermon on the Mount (especially Matthew 5–7). The cultural backdrop assumes a Mediterranean-Judeo-Christian ethic in which public teaching, prophetic authority, and practices of charity and hospitality were highly valued; metaphors like gates, fruits, and builders would be readily understood by agrarian and village audiences.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter closely parallels Matthew 7 (compare passages such as the judgment sayings, ask/seek/knock, the Golden Rule, the narrow gate, warnings about false prophets, and the two builders). Luke 6:37–42 and Luke 6:31 contain related material (judge not; mote and beam; Golden Rule), and the image of fruit-bearing to test teachers echoes prophetic and wisdom traditions elsewhere in Scripture (e.g., Jeremiah and biblical wisdom literature on conduct and consequence).",

  "chapterOsisID": "1Ne.20",
  "briefOverview": "A prophetic rebuke to covenant Israel for hypocrisy and idolatry, asserting God’s sole sovereignty. God refines his people, calls them to leave Babylon, and promises peace for obedience but none for the wicked.",
  "summary": "God addresses the house of Jacob, who claim his name yet act without truth or righteousness, and reminds them that he foretold events so they would not credit idols. Because Israel is obstinate, God has revealed both former and new things, refining them in the furnace of affliction for the sake of his name. He declares himself the first and the last, creator of heaven and earth, and asserts his plan against Babylon through the one he has called and made prosperous. He has not spoken in secret and, with the Lord God and his Spirit, has sent his messenger. As Redeemer and teacher, the Lord laments that Israel’s disobedience forfeited peace “as a river” and innumerable descendants. He commands them to depart from Babylon and proclaim redemption, recalling wilderness provision of water from the rock. The chapter closes with the warning: there is no peace for the wicked.",
  "externalContext": "This chapter closely parallels Isaiah 48, widely situated by scholars in the late exilic period (6th century BCE) when Judah lived under Babylonian rule. References to Babylon and the Chaldeans reflect the Neo-Babylonian Empire centered in Mesopotamia. In the larger Isaianic context, Cyrus of Persia is identified as God’s instrument to subdue Babylon and release the exiles (Isaiah 44:28–45:1). The imagery of refining in a furnace evokes ancient metallurgical practices, signifying purifying discipline for a covenant people. In the Book of Mormon text, the phrase “waters of Judah, or out of the waters of baptism” expands the Hebrew phrase and introduces an explicit baptismal interpretation not present in the Masoretic Text of Isaiah 48:1.",
  "externalReferences": "The exodus motif of water from the rock recalls Exodus 17:6 and Numbers 20:11, underscoring God’s past faithfulness as a pattern for present deliverance. God’s self-identification as “the first and the last” aligns with Isaiah 44:6 and Isaiah 41:4, a claim to unique sovereignty later echoed in Revelation 22:13. The call to leave Babylon parallels Isaiah 52:11 and anticipates the end of exile. The unnamed agent who executes God’s pleasure on Babylon (vv. 14–15) is commonly connected to Cyrus as presented in Isaiah 45:1–4.",

    "What practices would help me heed God’s instruction so that peace “like a river” grows in my life?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The identity of the “him” God loves and prospers against Babylon (vv. 14–15) is not named in the text here; many associate it with Cyrus from nearby Isaiah passages, but the chapter itself is indirect. Verse 16’s speaker (“and the Lord God, and his Spirit, hath sent me”) is ambiguous—variously read as the prophet, a servant figure, or a messianic voice. The phrase “waters of Judah, or out of the waters of baptism” reflects a textual expansion relative to Isaiah 48:1; its exact historical referent in this setting is interpretively debated.",

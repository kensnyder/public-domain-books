  "briefOverview": "A prophet (Nephi) is tested when a chief judge is murdered; his prophecy and a forensic sign expose the real murderer and split public opinion.",
  "summary": "Five men run to the judgment-seat to test Nephi’s prophecy and faint when they see the slain chief judge; later they are mistakenly arrested as murderers. The judges accuse Nephi of conspiring to foment the murder, bind him, and attempt to bribe a confession. Nephi pronounces a specific test involving the slain judge’s brother and predicts that blood will be found on the brother’s cloak; the test succeeds, the brother confesses, and the falsely imprisoned five are freed. Some are converted by Nephi’s vindication, while others respond by exalting him even further, calling him a god because of his knowledge.",
  "externalContext": "This episode takes place in the Nephite period of judges, a society in which prophetic figures frequently interacted with civil authorities and where political violence and factionalism occur in the narrative. Public judicial seats, assemblies for mourning and burial, and swift popular judgments reflect a communal legal culture rather than a modern court system. Prophets in this tradition are commonly tested by signs and often face rejection, slander, or attempts to coerce confessions from them.",
  "externalReferences": "The idea that God (or a divinely guided prophet) can discern or reveal the thoughts and hearts of people resonates with Jeremiah 17:10 (“I the LORD search the heart...”) and with New Testament notes that Jesus knew men’s thoughts (e.g., John 2:24–25). The pattern of leaders prosecuting or slandering prophets and demanding signs echoes Old Testament confrontations where prophets are opposed by political authorities (compare 1 Samuel 16:7 on God’s knowledge of the heart versus human judgment).",

    "How should communities weigh prophetic claims against ordinary legal procedures when they overlap?",
    "What safeguards can prevent rushed popular judgments like imprisoning the five men who fainted?",
    "How do we distinguish genuine prophetic insight from manipulation or coincidence?",
    "How should leaders respond when their attempts to discredit truth-tellers backfire?"

  "uncertainAreas": "The text leaves open whether the judges’ motives were primarily political, jealous, or genuinely concerned about order; the precise mechanics of Nephi’s knowledge (direct revelation vs. inference) are asserted but not described; the social and legal norms by which the crowd immediately arrests the fainting men are not fully explained.",

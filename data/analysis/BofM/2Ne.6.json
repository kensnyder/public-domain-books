  "briefOverview": "Jacob, consecrated by Nephi, reads and expounds Isaiah to teach about Israel’s scattering and gathering, the Gentiles’ role, and the Messiah’s future manifestation and judgment.",
  "summary": "Jacob introduces himself as a God-ordained teacher and explains his intent to read Isaiah to help his people glorify God, since Isaiah’s words apply to all Israel, including them. He quotes promises that the Lord will lift His hand to the Gentiles, who will aid Israel, with kings and queens becoming nurturing benefactors. Jacob then prophesies of Jerusalem’s fall and captivity, the Holy One of Israel’s manifestation in the flesh, and His scourging and crucifixion. He foresees Israel’s scattering and prolonged afflictions but also God’s mercy and eventual gathering when they come to know their Redeemer. Gentiles who repent and do not fight against Zion will be saved, while those who oppose God’s covenant people will be humbled. Jacob concludes with the Lord’s assurance—echoing Isaiah—that He will deliver His people and contend with their oppressors so all will know He is the Savior and Redeemer.",
  "externalContext": "According to the Book of Mormon narrative, Jacob is Nephi’s younger brother and an early religious leader among a group that left Jerusalem around the time of the Babylonian conquest (early 6th century BCE). The destruction and captivity of Jerusalem by Babylon in 586 BCE formed a historical backdrop for prophecies about scattering and future restoration. Isaiah’s writings were foundational for Israelite communities in antiquity, providing both judgment oracles and promises of redemption and gathering. In later Jewish and Christian traditions, expectations of a Messiah included both suffering and triumphant deliverance, themes Jacob highlights here.",
  "externalReferences": "The quoted promises to the Gentiles and the imagery of kings and queens as nursing caretakers closely reflect Isaiah 49:22–23, while the rhetorical question and deliverance oracle in vv. 16–18 align with Isaiah 49:24–26. The phrase that the Lord will recover His people “the second time” echoes Isaiah 11:11. Jacob’s note that those at Jerusalem would be slain and carried captive corresponds to the Babylonian conquest (2 Kings 24–25; 2 Chronicles 36:15–21). His prophecy that the Holy One of Israel would be scourged and crucified anticipates New Testament events (e.g., Matthew 27:26–50) and resonates with Book of Mormon prophetic passages like 1 Nephi 19:10–12.",

  "briefOverview": "A revelation commissions Edward to preach, promises the gift of the Holy Ghost through Sidney Rigdon, and extends a mandate to ordain and send elders to cry repentance. It closes with Christ’s self-identification and promise to come suddenly to his temple.",
  "summary": "The Lord blesses “my servant Edward,” declaring his sins forgiven and calling him to preach with power. He promises that Edward will receive the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, through the laying on of hands by Sidney Rigdon, enabling him to teach the peaceable things of the kingdom. Edward is to proclaim praise to God and announce repentance. The Lord then broadens the command: those who come before Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith and accept this charge are to be ordained and sent to preach the everlasting gospel among the nations, warning people to separate from a corrupt generation. This directive applies to the elders who embrace it with singleness of heart, and the revelation concludes with Christ’s declaration of his identity and the promise to come suddenly to his temple.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to the earliest months of the Latter-day Saint movement, when new converts were being rapidly organized and sent on missions. Sidney Rigdon, a former minister associated with the Restorationist/Disciples movement, had recently joined the church and quickly assumed leadership and teaching roles. Early Latter-day Saints practiced confirmation and bestowal of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, reflecting New Testament patterns. Within months of this revelation, Edward Partridge would be called as the church’s first bishop, and subsequent revelations would identify locations for gathering and for temples in Ohio and Missouri.",
  "externalReferences": "The language of warning—“Save yourselves from this untoward generation” and “hating even the garments spotted with the flesh”—evokes Acts 2:40 and Jude 1:23. The promise of the Comforter and the bestowal of the Holy Ghost by laying on of hands aligns with John 14:26 and Acts 8:17. The “everlasting gospel” and the declaration “I will suddenly come to my temple” echo Revelation 14:6 and Malachi 3:1, while the acclamation “Hosanna” resonates with Matthew 21:9.",

    "How do I prepare to receive and then act under the influence of the Holy Ghost in sharing the gospel?",
    "What does it look like to preach repentance with both boldness and charity?",
    "In what ways can I cultivate “singleness of heart” as I accept callings or assignments?",
    "How can I separate from corrupting influences in my environment while still reaching out to others?",
    "What does it mean, practically, to “gird up” my loins in anticipation of the Lord’s coming to his temple?"
  ],
  "uncertainAreas": "The text names “my servant Edward” without a surname; identifying him as Edward Partridge relies on external sources. The phrase “I will suddenly come to my temple” could reference an anticipated future temple (location unspecified here), making the referent ambiguous in this chapter alone. The scope of “concerning all men” in verses 4–7 may be rhetorical (a universal invitation) yet functionally directed to church elders; the precise limits are not explicit. The imagery “come forth out of the fire, hating even the garments spotted with the flesh” is metaphorical; the degree of separation from worldly influences it implies may be interpreted with some variance.",

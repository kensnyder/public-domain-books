  "briefOverview": "Guidance on temporary living arrangements, resource sharing, and prudent saving as the Saints await revelation of the city to be established and a coordinated gathering under appointed leaders.",
  "summary": "The Saints are instructed to remain where they currently live as suits their circumstances. Those with land should share with brethren coming from the east, and those without land should purchase as needed nearby so everyone has a place to live. They are counseled to save money and obtain resources righteously in order to buy land for an inheritance, the future city. The specific location is not yet revealed; after the eastern Saints arrive, certain appointed men will be shown the place. These men will purchase lands and begin laying the city’s foundation. Then families are to gather in an orderly way, according to their circumstances, under appointments from the presidency and the bishop in harmony with revealed laws and commandments.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to early 1831, when many Latter-day Saints were relocating from New York to Ohio following earlier instructions to gather. Edward Partridge had been called as the Church’s first bishop, with responsibilities related to properties and temporal welfare. The law of consecration had recently been introduced, framing stewardship and resource-sharing among Church members. A few months later, in July 1831, the location of “the city” (Zion) would be identified as Independence, Jackson County, Missouri, shaping subsequent migration and settlement plans.",
  "externalReferences": "Earlier instructions to gather to Ohio appear in Doctrine and Covenants 37:1–3, providing the backdrop for the influx of “eastern brethren.” The calling of Edward Partridge as bishop, relevant to the administrative roles mentioned here, is found in Doctrine and Covenants 41:9. Principles of consecration and stewardship that inform resource-sharing and purchasing are outlined in Doctrine and Covenants 42:30–39 and further detailed for property allocation under the bishop in Doctrine and Covenants 51:1–3. The promise of a New Jerusalem and gathering is expanded in Doctrine and Covenants 45:64–71, while the location of Zion is specifically revealed later in Doctrine and Covenants 57:1–3.",

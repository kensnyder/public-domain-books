  "briefOverview": "Brief directives on study, ministry, temporal labor, and church governance.",
  "summary": "The recipients are instructed to devote their time to studying the scriptures, preaching, confirming the church in Colesville, and performing necessary work on the land until they travel west for the next conference, when further direction will be given. Church actions are to be carried out by common consent, accompanied by much prayer and faith, because blessings are received by faith.",
  "externalContext": "Early Latter-day Saint organization in 1830 included small branches in upstate New York, one of which met in the Colesville area. Leaders typically supported themselves through manual labor while also preaching and organizing fledgling congregations. Regular conferences were convened to conduct church business, review callings, and seek direction, a pattern common among early American religious movements. The principle of common consent—church members sustaining decisions—became a hallmark of early Latter-day Saint governance.",
  "externalReferences": "The instruction that church matters proceed by “common consent” closely parallels organizational directions in Doctrine and Covenants 20:65, which requires that ordinations occur by vote of the church. The charge to “confirm” the church resonates with New Testament language about strengthening congregations (Acts 14:22; 15:41) and with the practice of laying on of hands to confer the Holy Ghost (Acts 8:14–17). The emphasis on receiving “all things” by faith coheres with broader biblical teaching about faith’s centrality (Hebrews 11:6).",

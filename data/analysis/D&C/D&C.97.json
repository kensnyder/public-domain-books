  "briefOverview": "The revelation commends humble seekers in Zion, directs the establishment of a school and a temple, and sets forth promises and warnings contingent on obedience and purity.",
  "summary": "The Lord blesses the humble in Zion who seek wisdom and truth, commends the school there, and appoints Parley P. Pratt to preside so long as he abides in the Lord. He promises to bless the school with understanding of scriptures and mysteries but declares that some must be chastened and unfruitful works exposed. The faithful who offer sacrifices as commanded are likened to a fruitful tree planted by a pure stream. God commands that a house be built in Zion according to the revealed pattern, funded by the people’s tithing, as a place of thanksgiving and instruction to perfect ministers in doctrine and the keys of the kingdom. If the house remains undefiled, God’s glory and presence will rest there and the pure in heart who enter will see God; if defiled, His presence will not come. Zion will prosper and be honored if obedient, but if disobedient she will face scourge and calamity; yet the Lord accepts her offering and promises abundant blessings if she sins no more.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to August 1833, addressed to Latter-day Saints in Jackson County, Missouri, then designated by church leaders as Zion. Tensions between church members and non‑Mormon settlers in Jackson County were escalating in 1833, culminating later that year in violence and the expulsion of the Saints. A “school” in Zion paralleled similar efforts in Kirtland (often called a School of the Prophets or School of the Elders), aimed at training ministers in doctrine and practical preparation. Commandments to build sacred houses in this period included both Kirtland (earlier in 1833) and an intended temple complex in Independence, Missouri. The terminology of “tithing” here predates the 1838 revelation that formalized tithing as one‑tenth, and in 1833 it functioned as consecrated offerings to support the work, including temple building.",
  "externalReferences": "“The ax is laid at the root of the trees” echoes John the Baptist’s warning in Matthew 3:10 and Luke 3:9 about unfruitful trees being cut down. The imagery of the faithful as a fruitful tree by a pure stream recalls Psalm 1:3. The promise that the pure in heart will see God resonates with Matthew 5:8, and the insistence that God will not enter an unholy temple parallels the New Testament’s emphasis on God’s holiness and the sanctity of His temple (e.g., 1 Corinthians 3:16–17). The language of a whirlwind of divine judgment aligns with prophetic warnings such as Jeremiah 23:19, and identifying Zion as the “city of our God” evokes Psalm 48.",

  "chapterOsisID": "D&C.130",
  "briefOverview": "A collection of Joseph Smith’s teachings on the nature of God, heavenly order, prophetic warnings, and the relationship between knowledge, obedience, and eternal advantage.",
  "summary": "The chapter teaches that when the Savior appears, people will see Him as He is—a man—and that social relationships continue in glory hereafter. It asserts that John 14:23 refers to a personal appearance of the Father and Son, rejecting the idea that They literally dwell in a person’s heart. Time is reckoned according to the sphere on which beings reside; angels who minister to this earth belong to it, and reside before God on a “sea of glass and fire,” with God’s dwelling described as a great Urim and Thummim. The sanctified earth will become a Urim and Thummim manifesting lower-order kingdoms, and individuals in the celestial kingdom will receive a white stone (Revelation 2:17) revealing higher-order truths and a new name. Joseph Smith prophesies of coming bloodshed beginning in South Carolina, likely connected to slavery, and recounts a voice promising he would see the Son of Man if he lived to age eighty-five, leaving the precise meaning uncertain. He teaches that intelligence and knowledge gained through diligence and obedience rise with a person and confer advantage in the world to come, because blessings are predicated on obedience to eternal law. Finally, he declares that the Father and the Son have bodies of flesh and bones, while the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit who may descend upon a person without always remaining.",
  "externalContext": "These statements stem from Joseph Smith’s teachings in the Nauvoo period (1843), portions of which were recorded by close associates and later compiled into the Doctrine and Covenants. The Latter-day Saint movement in Illinois at that time was developing distinctive doctrines about the Godhead’s embodiment and the eternality of relationships. Historically, the American Civil War began in South Carolina at Fort Sumter in 1861, with slavery as a central cause—context often connected by Latter-day Saints to the prophecy in verses 12–13. The Urim and Thummim in biblical tradition was a revelatory instrument used by Israel’s high priest (e.g., Exodus 28:30), a concept expanded here to cosmic scales. The chapter’s statements about planetary reckoning of time align with broader Latter-day Saint cosmology, articulated elsewhere in the tradition during the same period.",
  "externalReferences": "The chapter explicitly cites John 14:23, asserting that the Father and Son’s “coming” in that verse should be understood as a personal appearance. It also cites Revelation 2:17 regarding a white stone and a new name, offering an interpretation that the stone functions as a personal Urim and Thummim. The opening idea that believers will “see him as he is” echoes 1 John 3:2. The reckoning of time by spheres and proximity to divine presence resonates with Abraham 3:4–9 in Latter-day Saint scripture, and the prophecy of war beginning in South Carolina parallels Doctrine and Covenants 87:1–3.",

  "uncertainAreas": "Ambiguities include: whether the “sea of glass and fire” is literal or metaphorical; what precisely is meant by angels ‘belonging’ to this earth; the exact nature and use of the white stone and the “new name” as a key word; and the meaning of the promise about seeing the Son of Man at age eighty-five (Second Coming timing, a personal appearing, or post-mortal encounter). The rejection of God ‘dwelling in the heart’ may be rhetorical, raising questions about how it relates to other scriptures that speak of God’s indwelling presence.",

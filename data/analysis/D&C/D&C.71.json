  "briefOverview": "A revelation commissions Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon to publicly proclaim the gospel for a limited period, with promises of divine empowerment and protection against opposition.",
  "summary": "The Lord instructs Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon to open their mouths and proclaim the gospel and the mysteries of the kingdom, to the surrounding regions and within the church, for a defined season until further notice. They are to labor, bear witness, and prepare the way for forthcoming commandments and revelations. Readers who receive this counsel are promised greater abundance and power. The Lord directs them to confound their enemies, inviting opponents to meet them publicly and privately, assuring that faithful effort will expose their adversaries’ shame. He promises that no weapon formed against them will prosper and that those who oppose them will be confounded in God’s due time, concluding with a call to keep His true and faithful commandments.",
  "externalContext": "This revelation dates to December 1831 in Ohio, when early Latter-day Saints faced public criticism, notably a series of critical letters by Ezra Booth published in the Ohio Star. Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon had been engaged in a Bible translation project and other church duties; this instruction redirected them to public preaching and defense of the faith for a temporary period. Public debates and newspaper exchanges were common venues for religious disputes in the early 19th-century American frontier, making the directive to meet opponents “in public and in private” culturally apt. The church at this time was still small but growing, with congregations primarily in Ohio and New York.",
  "externalReferences": "The promise, “no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper,” echoes Isaiah 54:17. The challenge, “let them bring forth their strong reasons,” closely parallels Isaiah 41:21. The assurance of given words and wisdom before adversaries reflects Luke 21:15. Similar commissioning language within the same collection includes “open your mouths” in Doctrine and Covenants 33:8–10 and promises to confound adversaries in Doctrine and Covenants 6:29–30.",

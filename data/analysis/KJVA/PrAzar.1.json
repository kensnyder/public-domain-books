  "briefOverview": "Azariah prays from within the furnace, confessing Israel’s sins and appealing to God’s covenant mercy; God preserves the three companions, who then lead a sweeping hymn calling all creation to bless the Lord.",
  "summary": "Azariah acknowledges God’s justice, confesses Israel’s sin, and pleads that God not abandon his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, even though the people lack leaders and temple sacrifices. He asks that a contrite heart be accepted as sacrifice and vows wholehearted fidelity, requesting deliverance for God’s name’s sake. The narrative reports that the furnace was made exceedingly hot, but an angel of the Lord entered, turned the flames into a cooling wind, and protected the three. In response, the three offer a doxology blessing God’s majesty and kingship, then summon all creation—heavenly beings, elements, seasons, animals, peoples, and the faithful—to praise the Lord whose mercy endures forever.",
  "externalContext": "This prayer is part of the Greek additions to the book of Daniel (often called the Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three), included in the Septuagint and recognized as canonical in Catholic and Orthodox traditions, while generally placed in the Apocrypha by most Protestants. In Greek manuscripts it is inserted into the fiery furnace story of Daniel 3, between the moment the youths are cast into the fire and their miraculous preservation. The setting is the Babylonian exile under Nebuchadnezzar, when Judeans were far from the Jerusalem temple; for exiles, sacrificial worship was inaccessible, and the temple would later be destroyed in 586 BCE. The hymn portion (often called the Benedicite) became a longstanding liturgical canticle in Jewish and Christian worship.",
  "externalReferences": "The scene belongs to the fiery furnace narrative of Daniel 3 (cf. Daniel 3:8–30), here expanded to include the prayer and hymn. The appeal to the patriarchal promises echoes God’s pledges to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding innumerable descendants (Genesis 15:5; 22:17; 26:3–4; 28:14). The penitential tone and acknowledgment of God’s righteousness resemble exilic prayers such as Daniel 9:4–19. The cosmic call to praise parallels the creation hymns of the Psalms, especially Psalm 148 and the refrain “for his mercy endures forever” from Psalm 136; the promise of protection in fire resonates with Isaiah 43:2.",

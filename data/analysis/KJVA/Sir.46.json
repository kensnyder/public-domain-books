  "chapterOsisID": "Sir.46",
  "briefOverview": "A eulogy of Israel’s early leaders—Joshua, Caleb, the judges, and Samuel—highlighting faithful obedience and God’s decisive aid.",
  "summary": "The chapter praises Joshua as Moses’ successor who saved God’s elect, won battles with God’s help, and even saw the sun halted and hailstones defeat enemies, demonstrating that fighting against God is futile. It recalls Joshua and Caleb’s stand against Israel’s murmuring in Moses’ day and Caleb’s enduring strength and inheritance, underscoring the goodness of obeying God. The judges are honored for uncorrupted hearts and lasting renown. Samuel is celebrated for establishing rule by anointing leaders, judging by God’s law, and proving faithful as a prophet. He offered sacrifice as he called on God against enemies, and the Lord thundered from heaven to rout them. Near his death he testified to his integrity, and even after death he spoke prophetically to a king to confront the people’s impiety.",
  "externalContext": "Sirach (Ecclesiasticus) was composed by Jesus ben Sira in early second-century BCE Jerusalem and belongs to Jewish wisdom literature. Chapters 44–50 form a sustained “Praise of the Fathers,” retelling Israel’s history through exemplary figures to encourage covenantal fidelity in a Hellenistic context. Joshua led Israel’s conquest after Moses, followed by a period of tribal judges who delivered Israel from oppressors. Samuel bridged the era from judges to monarchy by anointing Saul and later David, establishing a new political-religious order centered on fidelity to the Lord.",
  "externalReferences": "The halted sun and hailstones reflect Joshua 10:11–14, where God aids Israel against the Amorites. Joshua and Caleb’s fidelity against the murmuring of the people recalls Numbers 13–14, and Caleb’s strength and inheritance connects to Joshua 14:6–14. Samuel’s sacrifice and God’s thunder against the Philistines parallels 1 Samuel 7:9–13, and his public integrity statement echoes 1 Samuel 12:1–5. Samuel’s posthumous prophecy to a king most likely alludes to his appearance to Saul through the medium of Endor in 1 Samuel 28:11–19.",

  "uncertainAreas": "The reference to “Tyrians” may reflect a textual variant or broad label for enemies; Samuel’s “not even so much as a shoe” differs from standard accounts of his integrity; the phrase “one day made as if two” and “bones might spring forth” are figurative and open to interpretive nuance.",

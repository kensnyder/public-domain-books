  "chapterOsisID": "Sir.19",
  "briefOverview": "A wisdom collection warning against self-destructive vice and careless speech, urging prudent correction and grounding all discernment in the fear of God.",
  "summary": "The chapter warns that indulgence in wine, sexual immorality, and malice leads to decline, disgrace, and loss. It urges restraint in speech: do not repeat harsh words, reveal secrets, or quickly believe every report; hold accusations and corrections carefully. The reader is counseled to correct friends and neighbors gently and promptly, recognizing that many stumble in words without malicious intent. True wisdom is rooted in the fear of the Most High and alignment with the law, not in cunning or deceitful humility. The text contrasts cleverness that distorts truth with God-fearing simplicity, and it notes that outward behavior can reveal character, while prudence sometimes chooses silence.",
  "externalContext": "Sirach (Ecclesiasticus) was composed in early second-century BCE Jerusalem by Jesus ben Sira and later translated into Greek by his grandson around 132 BCE. As a work of Jewish wisdom literature, it aims to shape moral character by integrating practical ethics with reverence for the Torah. The social setting included honor-shame dynamics where slander and rumor had serious communal effects, making counsel on speech and correction especially relevant. In many Christian traditions, Sirach is part of the Deuterocanonical books, while in Jewish and most Protestant canons it is not included among the Hebrew scriptures.",
  "externalReferences": "The emphasis that “all wisdom is fear of God” echoes the biblical maxim, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge” (Proverbs 1:7). Warnings about wine and sexual immorality parallel Proverbs 20:1 on the deceit of wine and Proverbs 6:32 on the self-harm of adultery. The cautions against repeating a matter or revealing secrets resonate with Proverbs 17:9 and 11:13. The teaching on stumbling in words and mastering the tongue aligns with James 3:2–10 about the dangers and discipline of speech.",
